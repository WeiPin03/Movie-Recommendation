View from the Top,3.81,3.75,"['Comedy', 'Romance']",A small-town woman tries to achieve her goal of becoming a flight attendant.,sadness,"['For the number of big stars in this movie, I\'m surprised more care wasn\'t taken to ensure it wasn\'t so horrible.The movie starts out promising, with kind of a campy nostaligic feel, but soon progresses into crapland. The script is awful, and it seems like the actors know it. Hearing Gwyneth Paltrow say ""what about your hickeys?"" in any context is just wrong. And Christina Applegate\'s acting style fit in on Married with Children, but that\'s because she was SUPPOSED to act poorly. On a feature film, that approach doesn\'t work. Mike Myers just should not be in this movie. His character is poorly thought out, and he just pulls out the same old shtick to compensate for a stupid character.This movie gave me that same sinking feeling I got when watching ""Cellular"". I knew it was just going to get worse and worse, that\'s what bad movies do.I gave this movie 3 stars. I don\'t know why I gave it that many. Maybe because Gwyneth looks good.', ""Middle of the road comedy about the dreams and experiences of a small-town girl (Gwyneth Paltrow) who longs to be an international flight attendant.Another forgettable comedy with (supposedly) high-powered talent that seems to be unused. Gwyneth does have a good comedic presence, and she looks good in the skimpy outfits, what with her lean, leggy body and all.But it's all just light fluffy trek. The movie struggles to even fill its 87 minutes with substance. Basically just girl from small town, longing for high life and glamour, trials and tribulations achieving her goals, and final realization that love and home are really what cranks. My, my, original indeed.Yes, Gwyneth is OK, not totally sleepwalking through this role. She obviously needs to be stretched artistically, though. The supporting cast don't provide much. Mike Myers' cross eyed instructor provides a few laughs, but seems mostly like an overplayed Saturday Night Live character.Candice Bergen seems settled into these time-killer comedies, and that is her prerogative. As the grand damme of flight attendants, she does get a couple of humorous lines, and her lispy, stilted, staccato, deliberate vocal delivery is always funny to me.5/10 because I did laugh a few times. When it's not funny though, it's not much."", ""Pleasant if unremarkable fluff has Gwyneth Paltrow pulling a Mira Sorvino, playing a hick-town cashier in Nevada who is inspired by a celebrity airline hostess and takes to the skies. Middling comedy-romance about flight attendants has Paltrow in unusually silly spirits; her role isn't realistic, of course, but it's a lot of fun watching her go through the ropes, gaining self-confidence and making friends. Her sweet relationship with Mark Ruffalo never gets in the way of the comedy and provides a nice capper at the end. Film begins skittishly, though it, too, gains confidence and composure despite 'scene-stealing' hams in the supporting cast and an abundance of what appears to be costume designs from the 1970s (yet the film takes place in the present day). Not a big success, but a minor enjoyment. ** from ****"", 'If you want silly, fun stuff, this is the movie to see.  Mike Myers was grand... nice to see him in a small movie. Gwyneth Paltrow predictably good indeed and Candice Bergen perfectly cast as the ""big-haired mentor"".It was relaxing to enjoy a lightweight comedy/romance with NO BIG MESSAGE, just smiles and a large number of giggles. I gave it 8 of 10.', ""in most movies, the girl wants to be famous in Hollywood and making millions. in this she just wants to be a flight attendant. its nice to see that and thats why i liked the movie so much. Gwyneth Paltrow was so good in this movie and had a great innocent charm to her. she just wanted to get out of her small dumpy town. the supporting cast was good as well, especially kelly preston who tells Gwyneths character about the top flight attendant company or whatever. Christina applegate, candice bergin and mark ruffolo are good as well and a great cameo from rob lowe. my only small problem with this movie was mike myers. he was funny as first then the whole eye joke got over the top and kinda stupid but none the less he was funny for a minute or so. view from the top is typical and u know whats gonna happen at the end, sort of. you know that shes gonna be happy in the end with her man but in this movie, the heroine's big dreams are simple and thats why i loved this movie so much."", ""Yes it's silly, but as an aspiring flight attendant this movie was right up my street. The cast was not mediocre in the slightest, with Candice Bergen and Christina Applegate's performances on a par with Mike Myers and the stunning Gwyneth Paltrow. Everything about it is camp and fun, with the uniforms and hair being two highlights. I bought this movie on DVD a couple of weeks ago, and have already watched it 3 times, and still not bored. Anyone thinking of becoming a flight attendant, despite this movie not giving a factual summary of what being cabin crew is, it will still give you a real taste for it. The only, and I mean ONLY disappointing bit was the end - but I'll leave that for you guys to decide!"", 'We meant to see A View From The Top on day one, but kept postponing it for one reason or another.  We finally saw it last night (a Monday, 4/7/03) at the fabulous and classy ArcLight Hollywood multiplex.There is no other way to put it.  A View From The Top is hilarious with a capital ""H"".Gwyneth Paltrow is really an excellent actor, transforming her character from an awkward ""Small Town Girl"" in the Midwest growing up and living in a trailer with her mother and 3rd stepfather, to an awkward flight attendant for a small commuter plane serving gamblers and Las Vegas, to realizing her dreams through mishaps, trials and tribulations at a prestigious airline company, and finally making her dream a reality by becoming a classy international flight attendant (with Paris and all the major European cities as her base), and only to discover that her heart is still aching for something else.This movie is definitely for men and women anywhere on Earth who have dreams and who do something to make their dream a reality.  Too bad this movie has not soared well with today\'s U.S. audience.  It was originally scheduled to be released in fall 2001, but after 9/11/01, it never found its place in the U.S.Candice Bergen\'s character is an inspiration.  I thought at first her character was false, but I was wrong.  Candice played her character straight and the result is she\'s very funny.  Mike Myers is very original as the airline company\'s chief trainer for flight attendants.  He developed and played a funny character to perfection but with an imperfect eye.Kelly Preston and Christina Applegate played their ""flight attendant from the midwest"" roles extremely well.  I really empathized with their characters, both the good and the bad.I thought that ""airline sex"" was going to be a sub-plot of this movie.  I was wrong.  This movie is as clear as a whistle.Mark Ruffalo plays Gwyneth\'s love against type.  Mark has a funny family, straight from the script pages of ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" (another Miramax movie).  Rob Lowe and Chad Everett have guest roles here, and how their characters mug and hug the camera.  Perfect.Finally, ever wonder why on earth did all these talents agree to make this small Miramax movie for nothing?  Simple.  This extremely positive movie was produced by Brad Grey --- their personal manager.I love the soundtrack and am buying one when it becomes available in record stores.Congratulations, Miramax and Brad Grey Films.  Here\'s wishing that this movie receive much, much better luck at the box office internationally.', ""Ok, it's not a very deep and profound movie, but so what?  This is the kind of a feel-good movie that you wanna watch on a Sunday afternoon with a bunch of friends or a date.  One of my favorite types of movie.\nI really loved the songs, the clothes and the performances.  Gwyneth is very sweet, I'm actually starting to like her after seing this movie and Shallow Hall.  Candice Bergen is adorable and perky.  She had some of the funniest lines of the movie and she's the best thing in it.  Mike Myers is funny but a little annoying sometimes.  Cristina Applegate, Mark Ruffalo and the rest of the cast are also very good.  I just wished Rob Lowe appeared more cause he's soooo cute!  I would have preferred if he was Donna's boyfriend instead of Mark Ruffalo. Oh well...I strongly recommend this movie, don't listen to what the critics say. You'll definetly have a good time watching it. 9/10""]",8,"['Comedy', 'Romance']"
Vinyl,2.25,2.0,['Documentary'],"A boy meets girl love story, set in New York City. Only problem is, she's with his best friend.",joy,"['At this point in my life I have seen worse and stranger films than Andy Warhol\'s Vinyl, but I cannot say that improved my viewing experience. The film is the pop-artist\'s interpretation of Anthony Burgess\' ""A Clockwork Orange"" and was made six years before the much more famous Kubrick version. Why is Vinyl not as memorable as the widely known and accepted 70\'s adaptation? The answer to that question is easy - Warhol\'s version sucks.Vinyl does follow the basic story of ""A Clockwork Orange"". Victor is a troubled youth who is taken in and made subject to a terrible experiment that makes him submissive to violence. If left at this, the movie would have been kind of neat, but poor production quality and significant artistic liberties make this an unusual and uncomfortable experience.In this film, the camera hardly moves. All of the characters exist is the same small space and world. Warhol\'s camera is the dictator over what is important, and it never allows the viewer to get a full sense of what is going on. This creates a cramped and almost unwatchable series of events that are sort of explained, yet hardly audible.The acting is almost laughably bad. The cast is made up of Andy Warhol\'s Factory regulars, and I would be surprised if any of them knew how to properly play a character. Some names that may shout out to art snobs are Gerard Malanga (in the lead role) and Ondine (as Scum Baby). Watching these ""famous"" socialite figures bumble through their lines is sometimes hilarious. You can hear voices off screen feeding lines to the actors. If they forget what they are saying they will just stop and move on to the next part. It is unbelievable that Vinyl got as far as it did in production.But that ties in to what makes Vinyl sort of interesting. This is not a film that was rehearsed ahead of time. The actors did not know their lines or cues or anything before Warhol put the camera on them and shouted action. Heck, it does not even have an opening or ending sequence of credits. All we open and close to is Warhol yelling the names of the cast and crew from off camera.There is also a very strange homosexual sadist scene around the end of the picture. I cannot confirm or deny whether or not the source material contained any sexual undertones, but Warhol must have seen them in there somewhere. I am not sure why they decided that leather masks and wax burning was the way to go, but I remember the torture scene in the novel to be a bit less...weird.One positive note about Vinyl is that the audience gets to see the beautiful Edie Sedgwick throughout the entirety of the action. She serves as almost a part of the set. She does not speak, but she smokes and dances and forces the audience to pay attention to her. It is no doubt that Warhol wanted her to be a star. She has a mesmerizing quality about her. Knowing the story of her tragic life and death, it was almost sad to see her first on-screen appearance. She did not look as though she knew what she was getting into with the Factory. Even if she did, she was out of place.Vinyl is not the least entertaining movie that I have ever seen, but I cannot understand why it has been deemed significant. Yes, an Andy Warhol telling of ""A Clockwork Orange"" might seem interesting to the everyday moviegoer - but the horrible acting, sound quality and direction makes the whole thing not worth the time.If this film had been directed by anybody else, I doubt the public would have ever even heard of it. I would have been okay with that. Pop-art and the fifteen seconds of fame may be the good things that Andy Warhol brought to the world, but Vinyl is a bad movie. I would rather look at the soup can for 70 minutes....', 'Andy Warhol very very loosely adapts ""A Clockwork Orange"". Gerard Malanga tells us all how much of a juvenile delinquent he is and then furious dances to Martha and the Vandellas while Edie Sedgwick watches. Then Ondine, playing his buddy Scum Baby, turns him in to a cop who has been sitting in a chair and laughing the whole time. The cop turns him over to a doctor who tortures him, which seems to be a real S&M kinda deal ... no faking. Malanga is reformed. All of this happens on one set with the whole cast present the whole time. At just over an hour long, it\'s way too long ... but the peak moments, like Malanga\'s dance or any randomly selected minute of Sedgwick sitting on the sideline, make the whole thing worth watching.']",2,['Documentary']
Vipers,2.57,2.29,"['Action', 'Horror', 'Thriller', 'Science Fiction']","A wealthy couple, unsatisfied in the bedroom, hire a virile young man as a groundskeeper. Affairs, deception, and murder ensue.",disgust,"['There is a break in the Universal BioTech laboratory and vipers escape. The CEO Burton (Corbin Bernsen) seeks out Dr. Vera Collins (Jessica Steen), who is researching the healing of breast cancer using the vipers\' venom, and tells that the secret facility was researching enhanced vipers to produce more venom.Meanwhile in the peaceful island Eden Cove, in the Pacific Northwest, the vipers attack the residents. The newcomer doctor Cal Taylor (Jonathan Scarfe), who has come from the army, leads a small group of survivors to attract the vipers and save the locals from complete destruction and they discover an evil plan of Burton and his chief of security John Staffen (Michael Kopsa). ""Vipers"" is a silly B-movie with a terrible conclusion. After the death of most of the residents, Nicky is happy in love with Cal and the annoying Maggie, who has just lost her parents, is smiling with Dr. Silverton. This is enough to qualify this movie as stupid and ridiculous. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""O Ataque das Víboras"" (""The Vipers Attack"")', 'A set of vipers has been taken by the scientists, and they have mutated them to make a cure for cancer... then their experiment goes awry, and all these vipers escape into the woods, and they are not only biting people, they are actually killing people, in a little town.I had low expectations because of Tara Reid, but frankly she was no worse than anyone else in the movie and may actually have even been good by comparison. I hate to almost say a good word about Reid, but there it is, the closest I may ever come.The problem with this film is easy to point out: the special effects. Snakes that take over an island and eat people (apparently including their clothes, bones and tents)? Sounds pretty good, like a classic 1950s sci-fi movie. Well, not this time. The snakes look so poor, they just ruin every scene they are in (which is most of the movie). SyFy has made a lot of poor special effects decisions, but this may be their worst.', 'Look out for the vipers! They are coming and they are going to bite your face right off of your body and then eat it and they you will be totes dead!Tara Reid might be able to save us from the vipers I sure hope so otherwise they will bite right through our chests and we will be so completely dead.I am scared of snakes and the scariest snakes of all are these vipers with their super strength and genius level intelligence. They are hunting us and will kill us all! They will come for us in our sleep and eat our heads off!Save us Tera Reid!', 'Right, well with a movie named ""Vipers"", you know exactly what you are getting yourself into. And whether or not having Tara Reid on the cast list is a positive or negative thing, well that is a thing that is up to individual determination.I decided to watch ""Vipers"" because I like creature features and also because it is part of the ""Maneater"" movie series. However, I can\'t claim to have much of an interest in the acting ability of Tara Reid, for better or worse.I must admit that ""Vipers"" actually was a fairly adequate movie taking into consideration that there are so many, many other movies with snake themes that are far more horrible and less entertaining than the 2008 ""Vipers"" turned out to be.Sure, this movie was campy and cheesy, but that is part of the genre and also a part of what makes the movie enjoyable and fun to watch.Now, the movie has Tara Reid on the cast list, and that might be some aversion to some viewers, but it should be said that she actually fared quite well in ""Vipers"", taking into consideration the concept of the movie and the limitations of the script and storyline from writer Brian Katkin and director Bill Corcoran.The special effects in the movie were for the most part actually quite good, and the snakes - again for the most part - looked realistic enough and passed as being believable. However, the fact that the snakes could growl and scream was just hilarious and it made the movie all the more cheesy and laughable.All in all, ""Vipers"" delivers what you would expect from it, but actually managed to stay afloat and not become as horrible as many other snake movies did. Was it a masterpiece? Hardly so. Nor is it the type of movie that you will watch more than once.', 'Why do people hate this movie? It not that bad. The acting is pretty decent. True, the snakes look like crap. I agree 100% with you on that guys. Tara Reid was hard to decide. In the beginning of the movie she does do a bit of bitching. I love the scene where she slaps her mother (i think) in the face. lol! Story is nice. It a pretty nice little snake flick. Watch it with an open mind!I Liked it-Zach', ""This was my sixth title I have viewed from the Maneater series. I wasn't expecting much at all except a way to waste a Sunday morning. However I was shocked. I was expecting them to use National Geographic footage of vipers lunging at people, but instead found a cool movie that I really enjoyed.Now some people just can't appreciate b-movies simply because they seem to actually care for the mainstream stuff and don't even want to give such stuff as Vipers a chance. If you want something award worthy your in the wrong place.However this is a fun little movie, I was into the characters and I'll say it's the best title I've seen from the Maneater series overall."", ""Arriving to be the town's new doctor in the Pacific Northwest, a local finds the townspeople suddenly bombarded by a series of attacks by a special breed of genetically-engineered vipers that are used in the making of a miracle cancer drug, and soon helps them get away from the deadly creatures.This one wasn't bad at all, and actually had some good parts to it. One of the best parts is that the film really gets a lot of good stuff from the snakes in here, starting with the fact that real snakes are used for the majority of the scenes here, as this a big step up from the usual Sci-Fi Channel scenes where the obviously fake creatures are shown, and showing the real snakes being in the action makes them work nicely. The fact the snakes are shown with a love to swarm victims and attack in high numbers is another big positive, which makes them really dangerous and allows for some pretty good scenes. There's a lot of fun to get from that behavior with plenty of biting all over the body, a savage-looking feasting sequence and rather good stalking scenes in here making for a series of pretty tense showings. The last plus is that there's a lot of action present in the film, as the snakes here are loose really early, tending to a lot of big scenes here. The initial attack on the town is pretty well-done including where they're forced to take cover despite not knowing what's going on that includes several really good sequences, from the attack at the police station to the cover in the van and finally the big part, where they find themselves forced out of the van and across the ground to shelter nearby with the snakes nipping and leading at everything that moves. There's also plenty of fun to be had from the opening in the lab when they get loose and the big attack at the bridge, while the ending attacks are the most fun. There's several fun swarming scenes on the escaping townspeople, a couple of inventive scenes that show them all battling back at the snakes, and all of the fun of the confrontation in the greenhouse is superb. From the stalking of the victims through the walkways through to the way the snakes are always present and manage to present great obstacles for them, and along with the fun kills present in the scene, and film overall, make for some fun times. While these are what make it really fun and enjoyable, there wasn't much else wrong with this one. The biggest issue here is the usual flaw regarding Sci-Fi Channel films about the utterly atrocious special effects for the snakes is still in effect for this one. The snakes in here, despite looking much better than usual, is still plagued by the fact that most of the time they still look patently fake when the snakes are active and moving about, which is where the fake-ness of them comes about most clearly. They don't look too bad when they're merely staying still, but moving around is not when they look good at all. The other flaw to this one is the fact that there's way too much family drama going on at the beginning of the film. These are in no way interesting or exciting, and all they do is make the film a pain at the beginning, not something that starts off the film on a good note. These here are the film's problems.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Nudity.""]",7,"['Action', 'Horror', 'Thriller', 'Science Fiction']"
Virgin Territory,2.83,2.92,"['Adventure', 'Action', 'Comedy', 'Romance']",Young Florentines take refuge from the black plague and engage in bawdy adventures and lusty exchanges.,joy,"[""I really wanted to like this film but instead I'm bemused as to how David Leland managed to make such a mess. The plot is scrappy at best, there are far too many characters you are supposed to care about you end up caring about none, it's never clear who or what the film is really about, the acting is below par and the nudity is gratuitous.The love affair between Lorenzo (Hayden Christensen) and Pampinea (Mischa Barton) is implausible and you can't help but feel that something is missing from the beginning of this film to help ground their relationship in something other than the odd coy glance. The acting isn't terrible but it is unforgivable in key places, in particular whenever Barton and Christensen kiss, which feel so forced and unnatural that it makes me wonder if Barton's real life boyfriend was on set watching.I wouldn't call this film a comedy however there are some very odd moments where it seems comedy is the intention but it just doesn't work. For example a cameo from David Walliams would be welcome in any comedy but in Virgin Territory it just doesn't seem to fit - his zany exploits are mistimed and misjudged.Also, there are many moments that defy all logic (what is Elissa suddenly doing in a lake on her own?) and a part me thinks that Leland was maybe trying to create a film that felt something akin to The Princess Bride. He failed, and he failed because I think he was also trying to create a film that felt like Zoro, or Sense and Sensibility, or Carry on Camping, or American Pie, or...in fact I don't think even Leland knew what he was trying to do.The sexual elements are also misplaced with one or two moments where it seems Leland was gunning for the gross-out-teenage-sexual-angst genre. He fails again, falling well short of what we're used to and only confusing the audience further.There are some facets of this film I did like: the film is pretty well shot and the scenery in many scenes is a joy. I found Count Dzerzhinsky (Matthew Rhys) a welcome light relief and his character by far the most interesting and Christopher Egan did a fantastic job of portraying Dioneo as the unhinged antagonist. However, these things could never make up for a film that really doesn't know what it's doing, which is a shame because it did have potential."", 'I love historical films and this movie appeared to be a fun filled, sexy love triangle romp through the beautiful Florence countryside. Against everything I stand for, I bought it without watching it first. BIG MISTAKE!!! The only redeeming features of this film was the countryside (magnificent), Tim Roth\'s acting, and the costumes (historical with a modern twist). Everything else was horrible!!!! The first 3/4 of the film is jumbled and apparently, plot less. So they fill it with boobs galore and winged penises. The love of Hayden C.\'s character for Micsha B.\'s wasn\'t even noticeable and lacked chemistry.To sum it up I\'d call it ""a wannabe soft core pron"". Ended up returning it for a better movie. And never again will I buy before renting!', 'Virgin Territory all together is just a mess of a film. After watching it, I can see why it went straight-to-DVD in the US. The film just lacked comedy, action, adventure and good romance. It felt really cheesy and the acting was pretty bad. The story just wasn\'t interesting and was sort of foolish. The lead actors; Hayden Christensen and Mischa Barton are pretty much lifeless on screen. Their attempts at British accents are laughable, Christensen is whinny when he should be heroic and his accent sometimes fades within the film, while Barton appears ready to doze off at any time. They both amazingly fail to change their facial expressions for the entire duration. The scenes in which Christensen pretends to be mute might have been his only good moments, but even here he is totally inadequate. Tim Roth was pretty decent in this film given the material he dealt with.When it comes to missed opportunities, it really doesn\'t get any more disappointing than this. ""Virgin Territory"" is based on a book filled with stories of sex and debauchery, and yet it somehow manages not only to not be sexy, but neither witty nor engaging on any level. An example of a cheesy sex scene was with two females and two guys performing a sex act with a milk maid and a cow. The film seemed more PG-13 due to its language but was rated R for a few nudity scenes (and they weren\'t really that good). Overall the film was just a mess and not funny. Don\'t even bother', 'This turkey has more breasts than Butterball in the third week of November.In one of the other reviews, the reviewer suggests that you could be forgiven if, at first, you think this is nothing but a soft-core porno pic... I would suggest that you\'re deeply mistaken if, by the end, you think it\'s anything else. And worse yet, it has fewer breasts and even fewer laughs (intentional or otherwise) than Bob Guccione\'s ""Caligula,"" with which it shares a certain sensibility.Think of it as ""The Decameron"" written and directed by Benny Hill, post mortem.', ""I laughed (out loud) once. I hardly think that constitutes a 'comedy' for me.There are a few witty one-liners, and a touch of situational humor, but most of the humor is pretty stale and dry. I think they were trying for something along the lines of The Princess Bride, but missed the mark entirely.There were a few sword-fights, but that hardly supports an entire 'adventure', and the plot was utterly formulaic and you could see 10 minutes ahead of the film at any given point.As for the romance, well, the ONE romantic idea present in the film just wasn't enough to qualify it for a romance film either.My hat is off to anyone who can find an ounce of drama in this movie either...So, what is it? Something to pass the time if you literally have nothing else to do. As I mentioned before, I'd recommend watching the Princess Bride if you haven't, or watching it again, rather than watch this.I gave it three stars because the acting wasn't terrible, there were those witty one-liners, and I did manage to laugh once."", ""Virgin Territory is for secondary and high-school teens. If you're older than 18, you can't get any taste from this work of fiction, or wise to say, a tale.Tim Roth, Mischa Barton and Hayden Christensen form a love triangle. Tim Roth is the bad guy, the grim Roman knight; Mischa Barton is the princess popular with her virginity; and Hayden Christensen is an adventurer exactly seems like Robin Hood. By the way, we have a narrator, our storyteller who also plays a role, too.The tale takes place in feudal Europe, at the age of Roman Empire, and in the most leisured class of this empire: Florence. It's the epoch just before the invention of the gunpowder. Nevertheless, there is no historical coherence in this movie; for it's a fantasy. An absolutely complete fantasy of a craftsman working at the construction of a cathedral, who is also our narrator. While he was drawing artistic figures to the ceiling, he dreamed of an erotic and desirous fantasy of one man and a full nunnery of nuns playing the doctor-and-patient game altogether.If you're not from this world or have never watched a B-movie about nuns teaching sexology to a lad yet, then this could be a movie for you. The eroticism factor of Virgin Territory is very modern. Within a negative view, it's purposely making fun of the people who don't believe in sex before marriage. In an optimistic view, love still exists; at least whoever in love with someone, stays in love with the same one at the end.A funny and total shameless teen adventure movie for both boys and girls is what you will find. Don't worry if it's disturbing, obviously it's not. It's basically a modernization of 80s' eroticism epoch. New generation youth wouldn't watch Emmanuelle, right?"", ""I found this movie a cute sketch of medieval life. The main actors are really good. Though it added to my collection of funny blunders about Russia and Russians which Hollywood movies are unfortunately abound in: the Count of Novgorod's Dzerzhinsky double first name Dmitry Vyacheslav sounds rather strange. Such names just don't exist. There is no double first names in Russian. Judging by his father's parental name Abram and the family name the Count of Novgorod is a polish Jew. Very funny but highly unlikely from the historical point of view. And the language\x85 The Count spouts Russian taboo words as one from the mob. Funny but doubtful. I do suggest the scriptwriters look for a better piece of historical and cultural advice."", 'A young man engages in debauchery and swashbuckling adventures in 14th century Italy. This film is mostly harmless, but an incredibly lame attempt to make a sex comedy set during the time of the Roman Empire as Europe is devastated by the Black Plague. The script and direction are so amateurish that it looks like a low-budget TV movie. It is difficult to buy Christensen as a swashbuckling hero, as he looks about twelve and has little screen presence. Roth looks embarrassed to have become involved with this project. The only selling point here is that there are some quite attractive women in the cast and they tend to disrobe with some regularity.', ""Of course this was not meant to be taken seriously. I mean just the fact, Hayden Christensens character pretends to be mute and deaf to get into the pants (or whatever you call what nuns are wearing) of the women that save him ... there's nothing more to be said about that. There is then nudity, though not from Mischa Barton, if that's your number 1 reason you want to watch.Mischa was quite on a hiigh with OC and all that. She never really managed to do anything with that fame, though I cannot tell you why. Could be a number of things, from roles offered, to maybe her limited acting range (unless again that was due to the roles she was offered) or just pure bad luck. Whatever the case, this is overall decent I reckon, but tries too hard - no pun intended. And the cliches (falling for a ... dick, is quite the .. dick move! Wait you think that's funny? Well maybe the movie is something for you after all)"", 'I found this film on the shelves of a French hypermarket on a day trip to Calais. Presented in the same font and style as the \'American Pie\' films, I have to say that the local French title ""Medieval pie - Territoires vierges"" did stand out, which was possibly the intention of the DVD marketing company, trying to trade on the success of a similar and more successful series of teen comedy films. Even now, after the event, I\'m still not sure whether any of the cast or crew of \'Medieval Pie\' have any involvement with the \'American Pie\' franchise at all. I\'m doubtful. I get the feeling that this movie will be known under a variety of titles in a variety of markets, and that alone should set the alarm bells ringing in the heads of most sane movie reviewers.There are a few familiar faces on display. Hayden Christensen, Mischa Barton and Tim Roth are the three most obvious \'names\', with \'Little Britain\'s\' David Walliams appearing in a blink-and-you\'ll-almost-miss-him cameo. The main problem is that all these actors are playing characters with hard-to-remember names. Barton is Pampinea, Christensen is Lorenzo (who for some reason masquerades as a deaf-and-dumb gardener in a convent where for some reason all the nuns have sex with him, a central joke that gets tired very quickly, even with all the nudity) while Roth is the main villain, Gerbino de la Ratto. I was rather more impressed with Matthew Rhys\' Russian Count Dzerzhinsky, who rattled off his name and lineage on several occasions without missing a beat - I could have done with a memory like that to remember exactly who was who. It was a struggle at times.My favourite scene was probably when the two women who get captured (Rosalind Halstead & Kate Groombridge I believe) try and escape by tricking their guards into dropping their trousers and lining up in order of size and then creating an argument about whether you start small and work up, or start large and work down (or even start in the middle!). That was fun. The main love story involving Barton and her three suitors (Christensen, Roth and Rhys) is perhaps not so successful, and the less said about the sex-obsessed nuns the better. It\'s an old fantasy for sure, imagining what nuns get up to behind closed convent doors, but not especially original.I\'ve seen worse comedies for sure - anything involving Aaron Seltzer & Jason Friedberg for one thing, but I have seen better too. I suppose for the genre it represents, this sits somewhere in the middle of the pack, so even though it did bypass the cinemas and go straight-to-DVD, it\'s not really that bad. It deserves one viewing at least, but whether it will hold up to multiple screenings is much less certain. I\'m not sure it will. I guess what I\'m really saying, is wait until the sales - don\'t pay full price for it - unless you have a thing about nuns getting naked, in which case this is a 10/10 movie for sure. For me though, it\'s just a five.', 'Anybody who thought this was a soft core porn movie would be forgiven. The whole \'guy turns up at commune and gets laid half a dozen times\'! What\'s that about, I ask? It\'s certainly not based on reality. That said the movie is not set in present times so perhaps we shouldn\'t judge the women within it on a modern standard, supposing nuns no longer put out for a good looking gardener. On that note probably best to stick to the guidance here, if parents are wondering, as it\'s bound to give us lads a false sense of hope at such a young age. It\'s not surprising given the directors talents! The movie is difficult to follow, with that results a surprising and interesting film. The actors are all well know teen actors, you will have seen them on the likes of Skins and OC, this is one of those movies that seems to be a summer break for actors, however they did not take a break in acting, if at times they seem a little hung-over, so to speak. There is also more than just a good cast here, there is a mix of nationalities, it varies from all over the world and this adds vastly to the period setting. There is a bit in the movie where the evil guy sees a musket for the first time, and that is a cool idea. What else could the evil baddie say to his minions other than ""I want that get me it"".Brilliant cameo from David Williams\'s (cart pusher) funniest moment of the whole movie. He is only in it for a short while at the beginning but its worth watching the movie for his part alone. It is important to say that id normally save my time for a movie that doesn\'t deserve its rating, this film is very luck to have a 5 and deserve it, you should watch it and see what you think.', ""It seems the other reviews either love everything about this, or hated it...Well, I have to say for what it is, it is OK and watchable if you know you just want a no brainer evening.It doess a real sense of fun without too much silliness and even a definite charm.It is sexy, and has a fair amount of nudity, but it's all done in a spirit of fun...It is a bit of Carry On, a bit of Romeo and Juliet, with sexy romance, and dashing sword fights, some decent one-liners and some running gags it all works if you're in the right mood.The plot is a take on the Comedy of Errors, three suitors, one girl, but one is mean and nasty, the other falls in love with another girl, and one is her true love... it ain't Shakepseare but it is fun to see what happens next.Nicely shot with good costumes and settings this is one to just enjoy for what it is: escapist comedy reasonably entertaining and fun..."", 'It was quite funny and not bad. The romance between them were OK. But I just thought, ""Whoa this has been directed by horny teenagers"". Because it was just, basically, all about sex. I liked the ending where Pampaneya ( or however you spell it) and Lorenzo (who is gorgeous) got together and the twist where the Russian guy got with Lissa (I think he name was). The convent was funny! But it should have been obvious he wasn\'t deaf/dumb. The \'priest\' was great! He was really funny, and at the end where he was showering flowers over them, that was funny too :) Commentary was funny throughout it. I liked the tribe bit, very funny. And Rupert Friend was great as the leader :) very funny! Overall, Good.', 'Of course this movie will never win an Oscar, but that is not what it aims for. It aims to entertain the audience, with a certain amount of nudity and sexual innuendo, and it does that quite well I\'ve to say. Mischa Barton and Hayden Christensen act their roles quite well, just like Tim Roth, and basically I can say that if you want a night of light entertainment, this movie can provide that.It is loosely based on the Decameron by Boccaccio, and if I have to find a problem with the movie, it is the Italian title for it, because really, the references to the Decameron are not so many, but at the same time, the situation of a group of young people leaving Florence for the plague is the same, so I guess it could be accepted. However, it\'s all the ""adventures"" these people go through once they leave the town that make the movie somewhat interesting and amusing.I know I\'ll be watching it again in the future.', 'This isn\'t exactly ""The Grapes of Wrath"" or ""Citizen Kane""...but so what? I found it a very adequate period-piece comedy that even occasionally had a hint of Monty Python humor. The musical soundtrack was decidedly 21st Century...but it ""worked"" for me.The cinematography was surprisingly well-crafted, in my opinion, and the acting was perfectly adequate, albeit nothing exceptional. All the actresses were decidedly attractive -- why do I think that 14th-Century nuns in an Italian convent during the Black Death were maybe not quite so hot as depicted here?? -- and Mischa Barton proves once again that she is a truly gorgeous young woman (although she was NOT one of the several females who had any nude scenes).Bottom line: worth a rental, and also an OK ""date movie"".', 'This nice, mild version the extremely bawdy Decammeron Nights, was so lightly thought of, it was released directly to DVD in the US.The only reason for the R rating is the a few of the ladies busts are shown,& some suggestive dialogue as same ladies are milking a cow over the clothed body of our hero. What this movie really needed (since the guys are so handsome),was at least a suggestion of some male sex (which was in the original stories). There also should have been at least one whipping or torture scene, or suggestion of. THe above ladies were supposed to be nuns, to me they were not.Hayden Christensen (Star Wars 2 & 3) is not bad as our stalwart young hero. Mischa Barton is delightful as our pure heroine. Matthew Rhys as a Russian suitor is a comic find,( his character has a very long hard to pronounce name) He rattles this name & his lineage a few times & never misses a beat.In fact the entire cast is a delight,The script & direction was by David Leland and is good. The settings are beautiful. This is not a great film or even a good adaptation,it is just an enjoyable pleasant,not bawdy enough treatment.Ratings: *** (out of 4) 83 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)', ""i watched this movie not expecting a lot. but wow, i got far more.this is a movie of love and the complexities thereof, of bravery, and indeed the sword fighting scenes were incredible. haydn was wonderful in it.the casting was beyond reproach, it was perfect :) many derided haydn's acting abilities, but he has proved himself in this movie :) i wont spoil it, but the ending made me smile, and it was as perfect as true love could be :D a wonderful movie. i give this movie 7 out of 10. it deserved more though frankly if you're looking for a great movie to watch, swashbuckling, everything i mention in my summary title, this is the one to watch :D"", 'If you\'re looking for an artistic depth, or even a semi-entertaining thriller, the ""Virgin Territory"" is not the right title, but then, at least as I see it,measuring up to the movies of the type is not the movie\'s idea. This is to be watched for the sake of lighthearted fun, Friday-night romance with your partner with a glass of wine, and, in general, a tint of ""letting it loose"". To be sure, more often than not the humor is failed and forced but I felt entertained by the gratuitous rascally nature of the characters, especially the men, rather than by the very jokes. Hayden Christensen, for the story he dealt with, was amusing and charming, if at times kinda bored. I assume neither he nor I were sure whatever he was playing - a chivalrous, rowdy medieval hero, or a clownish, immature ""Anti- Romeo"" - but the overall air of buffoonery he exuded kept my attention. Of course, the additional reason - for which I dare believe practically all of us (men) who watched the movie - is the erotica. There is a number of nude scenes in which the women (again, in an uninvited and absurd, but still all the more entertaining way) treat men with their bodily assets. Gensini\'s and Colloca\'s behinds were a hypnotizing watch, but I hated how the scene I consider to be the real gem of the movie\'s nudity, the one with Elisabetta Canalis (herself a professional nude model from back in 2003) lasts too short (we get to see the breast for like a 20th of a second, practically making the exposure redundant). Oh well, there\'s always the ""pause"" button...So, yes, enjoy the movie for the sake of semi-funny but melodramatically fulfilling romance and kill-time soft-core porn (I have a random hypothesis the latter was, in the long run, the actual motive this movie was produced - hence the lackluster ""comedy"" and ""thriller"" departments).', ""As a big fan of classic swashbucklers i wasn't expecting much of this movie and because of that I liked it very much. It's very low budget, but has some decent sword fights. Besides that its filled with beautiful women (actually beautiful) and yes, quite some nudity. But in a non-offensive and quite charming way. Mischa Barton is looking great as a historical figure (better than perfect-teeth Keira Knightley in PotC, P&P) and Hayden is quite good with his sword and a better swashbuckling hero than for example Heith Ledger in Casanova or Orlando Bloom. the movie is just great fun. its highly entertaining with the simple stuff: swords and love. i enjoyed it a lot. Actually the first entertaining swashbuckler of the 21st century."", 'If you\'re looking for an intelligent, well thought-out and realistic comedy, this is not the movie for you. Virgin Territory will never win awards, it will not be studied in film classes and most definitely will never be among the top movies ever made.However, if you\'re looking for a movie with juvenile humour, ridiculous sex references and just an overall silly movie, you\'re in the right place. That being said, this movie is hilarious. With a rather famous main cast including Hayden Christensen, Mischa Barton, Tim Roth and Mathew Rhys, somehow, even Mischa Barton\'s acting doesn\'t stink as much as normal. But, hands down the best performances go to Tim Roth and Craig Parkinson. Tim Roth as Gerbino di la Ratta, the villain and Craig Parkinson as Tindaro, the artist/priest and narrator. How either of them kept a straight face with their lines is beyond me.I can\'t say for certain, but there\'s no way this movie was made to be taken seriously. For crying out loud, they all have British accents when the movie is set in Florence, Italy during the Dark Ages. It follows the antics of six teenagers who flee Florence to escape the plague. What follows them is one Russian count, an evil villain out to steal a bride and a priest. Along the way they encounter a variety of obstacles and people, and somehow at least four sex scenes get thrown in before they reach their final destination.It\'s an over-the-top teenage sex movie that is an excuse to have boob shots, with a lot of purposely eye-rolling puns and ridiculous situations. It\'s not remotely realistic, and definitely isn\'t meant to be. But it\'s not as excessively crude as the American Pie: The Naked Mile, and such but more akin to American Pie I. But with better music.None of the above is necessarily bad; I found this movie to be a refreshing medium between overly sexed movies that try too hard such as the Scary Movie series, new American Pie movies and similar and the annoyingly stupid and obnoxious movies like as Knocked Up and 30 Year Old Virgin. Especially with lines like, ""Tindaro: (narrating about Gerbinos sex-life) There isn\'t much going on under his pants. Funny, I\'ve heard that he\'s the biggest dick in town..."" how can you not laugh?', ""I decided to watch this because of Hayden Christensen. I'm halfway through, and though highly amused, I find myself constantly asking what exactly I'm watching....It's got the corny feel of a campy porn, without the actual sex. There is plenty of female nudity, and almost every line and action implies sex. There so far is no actual follow through.It's entertaining if you're looking for campy, stupid humor. Don't look for more than though, this is definitely not intended to have any historical accuracy. The costumes, though good, are in no way realistic to the time. It's like a Ren-fair cosplay gone wild.Also.... WHAT KIND OF NUNS ARE THOSE!?"", ""All the basics you want in a film. Fun, villains, sex, humor, heroes, and a happy ending. But not predictable. No intense thinking material, yet there is intense thinking underneath.It might be viewed as a light-hearted Elizabeth the Golden Age, though on a smaller scale and in a different part of England. Out in the country where the big bad wolves and princesses in distress mingle.Makes me wonder why it didn't do much better at the box office. It certainly deserved to. I guess it's hard to market a film that may seem old, religious, and historical. In reality, the religion and history serve as a backdrop and the film never feels old.Tim Roth leads a cast of great acting. He makes the villain both hate-able and amusing."", ""I was shocked to see that this movie scores so low on IMDb, it is definitely one of my personal favourites.The plot seems to be the problem for most of the reviewers who didn't like the film. Well, what can I say other than it was taken right out of Boccaccio's famous Decamerone. Boccaccio being one of the most famous of all Italian writers EVER, and yes, he loved sexy, dirty stories with lots of rather ridiculous characters. (His works are available on Project Gutenberg.)What I like about it? It's tastefully sexy (yes, I love beautiful nudes), it contains some interesting characters like Tim Roth as Gerbino de la Rata, I especially like the first encounter with Count Dzerzhinsky and their exchange of words, Count Dzerzhinsky himself in his overly self-assured way, seems pretty cool too. The scene with the milkmaids in the cowshed is excellent too, revolutionizing pornography by giving the facial to the men (finally...)Comparing the movie to American teenage flicks like 'American Pie' is definitely an insult that I mind very much. It's about like comparing a Ferrari with a Chevrolet Avalanche.No, it's not deep, but does a movie have to be to be good??? Can it just be fun to watch?"", ""well i am not here to explain all about this movie!!! i saw this movie only because of Mischa Barton!!!! i love her acting and i love her talent!!! everything is perfect about her in this movie!!! well if u are a Mischa's fan u MUST watch this movie!!!! its interesting and its funny!!!

Virtual Sexuality,2.83,3.53,['Comedy'],"A frustrated teenage girl creates her perfect man in a virtual reality machine and in a freak accident, gives him life.",anger,"['It\'s hard to tell who this film is aimed at; the characterisation  and style smacks of a ""Children\'s ITV"" series crossed with an Aussie soap, yet the subject matter, nudity, and language aims it at an older audience.The first half-hour has the heroine Justine philosophising about losing her virginity, and is excruciatingly embarrassing to anyone over 18. A complete rip-off of ""Ferris Bueller"", from the talking-at-the-camera bit down to the on-screen graphics.Her nerdy friend Chas brings her to a computer fair where an explosion during the use of a virtual reality machines turns her into a man. Or actually, creates a male alter-ego of her, called Jake. Don\'t look at me like that; I\'m just relating it the way it was shown.After this the film is mildly amusing for a while; amongst all the drama-school  mugging, only Rupert Penry-Jones brings a real comic touch to his  woman-trapped-in-a-man\'s-body role of Jake. There\'s some funny scenes with Jake dealing with his new body, and new feelings; nothing you haven\'t seen before, but then in this film you\'ll clutch at anything that\'s entertaining.Unfortunately Justine and Jake meet up, and hilarious antics ensue (I wish), involving the  owners of the virtuality machine who want to kidnap Jake in order to have sex  with him, or examine him, or something. Anyway, it\'s just an excuse to  fill an extra half hour with some explosions and car chases; for such a cheap looking movie, the explosions come often and loud, suggesting  the money was spent in all the wrong places.In the end, the heroine realises she can\'t fall in love with herself, deletes  her alter ego, and ends up in a one-night stand with the nerd to lose her  virginity (this presumably is what is meant to pass for a happy ending in  the 90s). But only after he removes his glasses and puts some hair gel  and a leather jacket on; god forbid she actually have sex with someone  who _looks_ like a nerd. Of course, this is a bit subversive - in these days  of PC movies which tell you to love and be yourself, and that everyone is special in their own way, it\'s refreshingly reactionary to have a film  which screams ""CONFORM!"" at you, and treats virgins and nerds with the contempt they deserve.The characterisation is simple dire; the nerd is very nerdy (room full of computers, thick glasses, social retardism, virginity, no leather jacket), there\'s a slut, she\'s very slutty (blonde, tight dresses, orange tan, vampy accompanying music), there\'s a jock, he\'s very... well, you get the picture. You can get away with this kind of characterisation in a broad comedy, but ""Virtual Sexuality"" isn\'t very funny. It\'s only mildly amusing in parts, and excruciating in others. It takes a lot for a woman as cute as Justine (played by Laura Fraser) to annoy me, but she manages it.Don\'t be fooled by the title; there\'s absolutely nothing erotic about the film, and it doesn\'t deal with the topics of how the new communications technologies are changing the way we view and acquire relationships (unless you actually think there _is_ a chance your PlayStation might blow up and change your sex).', ""Virtual Sexuality proves that Britain can produce romantic comedies as vapid as those from America. The only differences are an ending that ties up the loose bits differently than an American film would and a cameo by Ram John Holder, which is always welcome. That's enough to make this a watcher on a cold winter's night."", 'A British teen movies which centres around a girl (Justine) accidentally creating her dream man (Jake) in by the use of a virtual reality machine, there is only one problem (well\x85.not just one\x85) she gets trapped inside his body with a geek as the only person who knows the truth and the only person she can trust. It sounds a lot worse than it is, I found it more watchable for the reason that Laura Fraser was starring in it more than the film content, indeed she looks stunning throughout especially when she dresses in a red lycra dress in order to impress Jake, WOW!!, If only I had a virtual reality machine', ""This movie plays out like an English version of an ABC after school special, with nudity. It makes you wonder who the target audience was supposed to be. It's not as though the writers were too preoccupied with selling a plausible plot either. While it does possess a certain watchability, Virtual Sexuality is fluffier than dandelion meringue. It's a good movie to watch if you're snowed in, the cable's out, and it's the only tape you've got."", ""Okay, so it starts very unimaginatively with a narration from the lead character (Justine played by Laura Fraser - an amazing actress in her own right) but it goes on to become something miraculous. It has silly little things that you really shouldn't find funny but do every time. There is an especially memorable moment that sees your jaw dropping to the ground the first time you watch it when the male body of Jake, containing Justine's female mind, is trying to get used to her new anatomy. I wont spoil it for you, but the second time I watched it was with friends; seeing their faces was brilliant. It makes you cringe, but laugh at the same time. I am also a big fan of the music used. There is a beautiful small band that appears randomly on the street or on a pathway every now and then, but also some gorgeous, yet unknown (often the best), pop songs. It has the feeling of being written for an English cast by an American writer, which does annoy me only a couple of times. Overall, this film is hilarious. I am a massive fan of Laura Fraser's now, after being given his film for my birthday, and expect that, even though some of the cast are little-known to most, you too will enjoy every bit of it."", ""Nobody that sees this movie will tell you that the plot is spectacular or brilliant, but I think most people will be fairly entertained by it.  There are, as in most movies, some slow times or failures, but there are some interesting developments dealing with the main characters, primarily how the girl acts in her new body as a guy.  It's really a toss up whether or not the movie is worth seeing.  If you're in the mood for a fairly simple but mostly entertaining film, go ahead and check it out.  If you prefer heavy or artistic movies with flawless and deep plots, you should probably avoid this one.  It is also worth noting that the English accent is sometimes hard to understand, so if that annoys you, this movie will too."", 'Justine (Laura Fraser) is a Londoner teenager, frustrated for not having a boy friend and for not having had sex yet.

However, due to an accident with a great explosion, the virtual man becomes real. He self-calls Jake (Rupert Penry-Jones), becomes a close friend of Chas and is a good athlete and successful with the girls. The predictable conclusion of the story offers no surprises. ""Virtual Sexuality"" is a silly, but also funny romantic comedy. The actresses are very beautiful, the soundtrack is excellent and in the end, this movie is a good entertainment. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Sexualidade Virtual"" (""Virtual Sexuality"")', '""Virtual Sexuality"" is an above average movie about teenagers aimed especially at a teenage audience. It does include the traditional ingredients of similar movies, like the interest for the other gender, the good hearted nerd, the school\'s babe, the stupid jock and the silly parents. Yet is it different. Firstly because it is British (taking place in London) and not American as most films of the kind. Secondly because it contains an interesting twist (the duplication, as a man, of the female lead). Thirdly because the movie is told mainly from a female perspective. It does have some good points about relations between girls and boys in their upper teens, and they are told in a funny and inventive way. The main asset of the film is however Laura Fraser who plays the female lead, Justine. She is not only beautiful in a fresh and believable way, but also very, very charming. The movie wouldn\'t have been the same without her!', 'Justine is still waiting for her first real romantic encounter. She has had opportunities but has skipped them, for she longs for the whole package; that is, true love. When she goes to a technology fair with a friend named Chas, she enters a booth and is urged to ""create"" a perfect male for herself on screen. Yet, a freak accident results in her newly fangled male, Jake, to pop out of the screen and be a living specimen. However, he does not want anything to do with Justine. Justine is in despair and resolves she\'ll ""just get it over with"" with someone else. No, no Justine! Don\'t do it! This is a British film with some good moments. Watch Justine on her actual dream date, riding down the Thames in a boat, for example. Now that\'s lovely. The young actors are all adept, although the man playing Jake did not seem like a ""dreamboat"" to me. The London setting is fun and the dialogue perky, although there is some bad language thrown in.

If you're into British humor, you'll definitely enjoy at least some part of this, as it's packed with it. Some of it is basic, and some of it is wacky, but most of it is good. It deals with a lot of the questions and stuff guys and girls have with having sex as a teenager. The plot is nowhere near realistic, nor very interesting, but it has it's moments, and the humor is worth sitting through the movie for. At the very beginning, the movie was at it's funniest, and after that, it gets slower and less funny, at a continuous downwards loop... unfortunately. But, it has some incredibly funny moments at several points in the movie, so it's worth checking out, unless you can't stand British humor or the heavy British accent that every single person in the movie has.

The characters in Virtual Sexuality, particularly the females, are exactly what British teenagers are like, I felt like I was almost in the film.  I immediately related to the character of Alex from the film, his shyness is quite common in most British teenage boys, especially around girls. Virtual Sexuality made me feel really good as its one of the only British films that isn't about gangsters or the middle-upper class, but about the people who are watching the film, average teenagers.  Americans wouldn't really feel the emotional attachment, but every British teenager should watch it.

Although there was some male frontal nudity (in fact, more than your typical soft-core title -- go figure!), this was not the focus of the film.  It was just fun.Don't be deceived by my tastes: my recent screenings have included Before Night Falls and Europa, Europa (both geat, IMHO).

I like, or rather love, a good movie about Vlad, Dracula or vampires, but in this case I was really disappointed. Vlad wasn't even scary.This could have been a good movie, but the script totally f**ked it up.

Vlad is better then say... way of the vampire. And in i\'ts defense i can say that Hollywood hasn\'t put out a decent vampire movie in... well... i guess the early 70\'s. And yes i am counting the chick flick ""bram stokers Dracula"".Oh, and if they ever make a movie about Lenin, Billy Zane should play the lead! Anyway, don\'t rent or buy this... pick up a copy of ""dracula 2001""... it\'s rubbish too... but you can always amuse yourself by staring at Jeri Ryans tits. Unless you\'re in to the whole goat boy look, then Vlad is the movie for you!', 'A lot of people in the comments are giving this movie more stars than it deserves for ideas, or a different approach to the Dracula mythos than the usual vampire schlock. And in fact the makers of this film reached similar points to the novel ""The Historian"" from different paths. It is obvious from their dates of publication that both researched the topic heavily but neither influenced the other.Anyway, perhaps it started out with a stronger script and got destroyed in editing, but the mess that we\'re left with at the end is pretty bad. Unforgivably bad plot movement, TV-movie cinematography and terrible editing whack this film in the end. You might enjoy parts of it, but the end result is a confused mess. There are good performances - by the entire cast, mind you - and lovely, appropriate locations. Certainly better than the abysmal 2005 ""Way of the Vampire"", but unfortunately the shortcomings outweigh the positives here.', ""i will be fair here and say that i didn't watch the whole movie.the reason is i found it way too slow and boring,plus it just looked too low budget.low budget isn't always a bad thing,when the rest of the movie is good.sometimes you don't even notice the budget.for me that is not the case with this movie.i have heard of some of the actors in this movie,and they've done some good work in the past.but in tis movie,it just seemed like no one wanted to be there.this is just my opinion and i could be wrong,but that's how i saw things.anyway,the bottom line is,from what i saw,this movie wasn't going anywhere fast.i give Vlad a 3/10"", ""Go google the 'summary' above and find out which song by whom these lyrics are from. Hèhèh.Okay, never mind that, I'll get to the point and keep it a simple one: VLAD's a pretty lame and pointless movie about... ehrr, yeah, well, actually, what was it about again? Let's see: a group of students are sent off to study the myth of Vlad Tepes, aka Dracula. They visit some historical sites. Then a girl from a few centuries ago shows up and so does the ancient Vlad, through a portal in time, or something. Apparently, one of the students has this amulet that should be buried again to lay the evil Vlad to rest... Pretty boring movie where nothing really happens and one that occasionally shoves some historical facts concerning Vlad The Impaler down our throats, instead of showing him committing his vile acts. Vlad just seems to be nothing else but a fool in love... Billy Zane was a hoot with his Rrrrrroumanian accent. I had quite a laugh with the scene where he unsuspectingly encounters Dracula in the woods. Without any hesitation whatsoever, Mr. Zane starts hitting Mr. Tepes in the face, real hard. Pretty funny. Brad Douriff was wasted on this film and really hasn't got that much screen time. This flick is for Vlad Tepes-completists only..."", ""I read a couple of the other reviews of this movie and didn't think that most of them were fair. I really think this was just an average movie, not a good or bad movie, just average.I watch a lot of movies and love anything about vampires, but this movie didn't really do it for me. There was a lot of information about Vlad, but there wasn't a whole lot of info about vampires. Without giving anything away, I'll just say that the causes are Vlad's vampirism were nothing you haven't heard before if you've seen more than one vampire movie. With all the build up about Vlad, I was hoping for a more original plot. However, I don't think that because the movie failed to be original that it should count against it, I just think it shouldn't be praised for it either.Besides the plot, the movies did have a pretty good production value. I'd say that it was a bit better than a made-for-TV movie but obviously not a big budget film. Just because it's an independent movie doesn't mean that its great. Independent companies put out plenty of bad movies, but this falls somewhere in-between.I wouldn't say this movie is worth watching, but I don't regret watching it either."", ""I watched Vlad not once, but twice. I love vampire movies, but this was just one of many that was less than thrilling. It wasn't the worst, but it wasn't the best either.I tried to give it another chance and I admit that I understood it better the second time around, but like so many others before this, it just didn't do it for me.I enjoyed Brad Dourif and Billy Zane, but there roles weren't quite what I expected. I'm fans of their work, but not really of this film.If you're a hardcore vampire movie buff, I would probably say that you will get bored with portions of this film. Again, it's not the worst, but it's a little dry...."", 'First of all, ""Vlad"" is a different kind vampire movie. It has almost nothing in common with the typical vampire movie and moves further in the Gothic fantasy genre, horror-fantasy would be a better term. Far away from typical clichés of the genre, this movie presents us a twist in the well known history of Count Dracula as it removes any link to Bram Stoker\'s novel and focuses on the myths that inspired Stoker\'s novel. This movie is a tale of Romanian vampires.The plot is a bit confusing, but at its core, it is about four graduated students who are selected by a Rumanian organization that will fund their research for their final thesis as their projects deal with Rumanian folklore and/or Vlad Tepes, the legendary ruler of Valachia who inspired Stoker to write the famous novel. The organization, lead by Radescu (Brad Douriff), is in fact a facade for an ancient order created by Tepes centuries ago, and their purposes will reveal when one of the students, Linsey (Monica Davidescu), reveals her secret: Her family had stolen a medallion from Vlad\'s grave.The secret powers of the medallion will create chaos as the members of the order try to find it, for different purposes everyone, and the students are in the middle of the struggle aided by Adrian (Billy Zane), a loyal agent of Radescu who tries to avoid the rebirth of Vlad.Now, the plot is for once very clever and quite interesting. The writers really did a great research when they wrote the story as it includes pieces of real history, Romanian folklore and Vlad Tepes\' biography. Of course, spiced with fantasy and horror elements. Nevertheless, this is also its big problem, the movie tries to accomplish many tasks and this creates a confusing script. Certainly, a bigger budget would have resulted in a longer movie, and a longer movie would have fixed the confusion.Depsite that huge problem, the movie works at its level, with an incredibly looking visuals, thanks to the beautiful Romanian locations and the amazing camera-work. It\'s indeed surprising how much they could make with so small budget.Sadly, the budget hurts the SFX and they look as if they came from a cheap TV series. This indeed decreases a work of good quality, but fortunately, they focus on acting and not in SFX, so it is not that notorious.The acting is very good, and the young actors show promise. While some of the characters were not very developed, the actors did a good job with the little they had and the result is pretty good. Again, a bit more of care in the script would have resulted in outstanding performances, but yet, the actors carry the film with grace.Last but not least, the most remarkable feature of this movie is without a doubt the music. It is an outstanding work and it is a shame that the movie had not been more known, because the music is really outstanding. Few times a b-movie has a score this good and the movie really makes the most of it.While probably this movie is not Oscar material, it is certainly among the best vampire movies of this decade. Or at least, among the most original. A great fantasy movie. 6.5/10', ""In Romania, four students (two Americans \x96 Jeff Meyer (Paul Popowich) and his sister Alexa (Kam Heskin); one British \x96 Justin (Nicholas Iron); and one Romanian \x96 Linsey (Monica Davidescu)) are selected by Radescu (Brad Dourif), the dean of a local university, and his assistant Adrian (Billy Zane) for a research about the life of the prince Vlad (Francesco Quinn). Linsey has a powerful necklace that belonged to Vlad, which was stolen many years ago by a former relative of her from the grave of Vlad. She intends to return it to the tomb. Meanwhile, a society that worships Vlad wants to retrieve the necklace. While in their way to the castle of Vlad, the group meets Ilona (Iva Hasperger), a woman from the Middle Ages, who was brought to the present days by the power of the necklace. Later they fight against the evil Vlad. Although having wonderful locations, photography and soundtrack and a cast with beautiful women, this movie does not work well, having a very confused story. With some improvements in the screenplay, it would be a good movie. The director and writer could at least spare the viewers from such a corny end. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): `Vlad \x96 O Cavaleiro das Trevas' (`Vlad \x96 The Knight of the Darkness')"", ""Vlad doesn't turn out to be the film you'd expect when you see that name, and it's much better and much more interesting than its cable/TiVo synopsis might lead one to believe. Because it's not just another vampire movie, or even a restless, tragic spirit movie. Vlad is an intriguing blend of historical fact and supernatural fiction. It's a movie with both a brain and a heart; the script believes its audience is at least IQ 80 and it doesn't treat the viewer as an imbecile, or an ADHD blood-and-guts freak who needs some lame-brained pseudo-action sequence every 7.5 seconds in order to stay interested in a film. Don't get me wrong; there's action, and there's plenty of supernatural trappings to Vlad. But there's also knowledge to be gained from the literate script, and heartstrings to be (rightfully) tugged by the backstory and plight of the tragic eponymous character. Good acting, superior writing and a marvelous grace note ending make Vlad a film that will stay with you long after you've first viewed it, and that only improves on repeat viewings. It's certainly not for everybody, but if you enjoy a film that doesn't insult your intelligence whilst telling you a fascinating story, then Vlad is the film for you. It could well become a classic if only more people were to take that chance and give it a try. It's really *that* good."", ""24 May 2005. This version of Dracula uses authentic location and the people of Romania to the best effect in this quality, independent production. With a sincerity and viciousness, Dracula is portrayed in historic terms without a soul or humanity. The acting is honest and mostly pure. With a limited budget, the special effects at times are a distraction while the music, however, resonates and merges with the mystical tension that surrounds this movie. At times, the dialogue and the characters tend to shade into stereotypical two-dimensions but only bits. Overall, this movie is superior to most flat attempts to recreate the Dracula mystique. Vlad has successfully caught the images, the historical context, the seductive power and vibrant horror/attraction of an age that appears in the present. This is an enjoyable, informative, and powerful movie that didn't quite have the resources to carry off a great movie. Seven out of Ten Stars."", ""This movie kept my attention, and kept it till the end. The actors all did a solid job of making their parts live.  Brad Dourif and Billy Zane gave the film class and credibility.  Kam Heskin is a hottie, and carried her part well.  Francesco Quinn makes your skin crawl in this horror genre tale, admirably making the role of Vlad the Impaler come to life and chilling you down to your socks! (He looks a lot like his dad Anthony Quinn in some of the scenes)  The Romanian actress (whom I've never seen before) did a great job of looking terrified & sexy. I wonder if she speaks any English? If not, she did a great job of handling the wordy role. The musical score really punches up the terror in the scary scenes, and sounds like a score from a Hollywood major film. This movie was filmed on location in Romania, with the major horror parts actually filmed in the Carpathians at Vlad's real castle. The Dracula character takes on a new & completely different direction, which in no way mimics former Dracula movies.  I enjoyed this one...."", ""When I saw the teaser for VLAD I was not expecting much, but I was actually impressed. VLAD has a very interesting premise once you get passed the initial campy start of college kids chasing the vampire legend. I agree that some of the editing might not be the best at times, but that's to be expected on a low budget.The casting was good and did a good job delivering the dialog in a believable way.I would recommend this to anyone that wants a break from the action/adventure visions of vampires or anyone that just enjoys a little more substance than a goth/s&m vampire flick."", ""I've read other people's comments and I'm surprised that a couple had so many problems with this movie. Vlad is the perfect mixture of historical fact and Romanian myth. It takes the whole vampire myth and returns it to it's rightful owner. Vlad Tepes was the basis of Stoker's Dracula and the vampire myth started in Romania and it's surrounding countries. I really liked how this movie didn't have the cinematic bloodsucker that we are all too used to, but instead had a tortured spirit that was doomed to wander the earth. The photography and locations are impressive (shot in the Carpathians) and the characters are believable. I'd definitely recommend this intelligent vampire story to anyone who is a genre fan, into historical pieces, or even just needs something to watch on a Friday night. I think that anyone who comes into this movie looking to see it for what it is, not some hack and slash horror film but a look into the historical Vlad mixed with a modern day adventure element, will enjoy the movie."", 'I\'d like to make a few points to einherjer9. First of all, it\'s obvious by his ""review"" that he didn\'t see the movie, but instead read the synopsis and made a judgment... Second, this is a fun movie to watch that does delve quite a bit into the historical ""Vlad Tepes"", more so than any other fantasy/horror film ever has. If he wants to see a historical film about the actual ""Impaler"" then he should check out ""Dark Prince: The True Story of Dracula (2000)"", which I\'m sure he would trash too. Last... This is NOT a ""Hollywood"" film in my opinion. ""Hollywood"" films are the big studio movies that are cranked out without care for much more the making money. ""Vlad"" was made by an independent production company, in the vein of when independent meant something, not in the sense of independent like Miramax and Dreamworks. ""Vlad"" was made for what studios pay one actor to appear for five minutes in a ""Friends"" episode... Yet it looks better than most $50 million dollar movies. So all I can say to our friend ""einherjer9"" is that before he trashes ""the independent film maker"" he should at least have the courtesy to see the movie.', ""As a fan of independent films, I expect some sort of originality and a unique approach to the story. The fact that this has the vampire aspect about it could have made it just like all of the other hundreds of vampire movies out there. But I was pleasantly surprised when I saw VLAD. The story gives the viewer a little history lesson about how the whole Dracula phenomenom started. I for one, had no idea that Dracula is based off of Vlad the Impaler, a real life terror to people during the 15th century. This wasn't a movie about a blood-sucking monster but rather about 4 students who go to Romania to research different aspects of the myth that surrounds Vlad. Without giving away too much of the story, I'll just say that it was a very different and interesting take on the vampire myth. The first thing I noticed about this film was how breathtaking the cinematography was. Shot in the Carpathiean mountains, the outdoor scenes are absolutely beautiful. Between the scenery and the musical score alone, I found the film to be very haunting and realistic. This film is the first for the director and was independantly done which means low-budget. I'm amazed because it looks so beautiful and better than some big-budget features that are out in theaters right now. I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to see a unique and different approach to a film that isn't about vampires but about a myth that has love, devotion, and ultimately vengeance."", 'One of the film types I collect are Vampire films so Vlad was needed for the collection. I did not expect much when I saw the IMDb rating. However the 3.5 rating is from people that were to cowardly to leave a review to explain their low rating.Vlad is not an easy movie. The first time I watched it, the story line seemed confused and I was not much impressed. However there was something that I liked, so I watched it again. The second time I put more effort in to really watching the film and I found I quite liked it. It is slow paced, but I like slow paced films that take their time. I liked the characters and I loved the locations. I also found that the story line is not confused but twisting.I seriously doubt that most people would like this film, but if you like the subject mater and are willing to put some effort in to the film, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.', ""I was lucky enough to catch this film at a screening in Los Angeles and enjoyed it immensely. What I liked most was the way the film blends all the classic elements in a traditional vampire film, but remains unique in its approach. Rather than relying on blood and gore, it portrays Vlad the Impaler as more than a monster. We're shown glimpses of his past and quickly empathize with his pain, even as we're terrified by his brutality.The love stories woven into the film and the pace at which it's told keep you emotionally invested and on the edge of your seat. The tone and feel of romance, aided by the beautiful backdrop of the Carpathian mountains, is undeniable and moving.The film carefully balances love and anguish while merging past and present worlds. Even though it's set in modern day, the film shows how we as people face the same struggles throughout our history. Vlad is incredibly well thought out and acted, and should be enjoyable to a wide range of people. The nudity and violence in the film is done with taste and purpose and I'd recommend this film to anyone that wants a romantic saga about one of the world's most notorious monsters."", ""This one kept my attention and is based more on the actual Vlad Tepes (Dracula) rather than Bram Stoker's version of the 15th century Prince. The movie is set in present day. Four graduate students venture to the Carpathian mountains of Romania to conduct research on the historical Vlad, one of them bears a necklace that Vlad was buried in. The group begins a two day 50 mile hiking trek through forests and mountains to a little known and inaccessible set of crumbling ruins at Poenari, a fortress built by the historical Vlad Tepes. The artifact, a 15th century necklace, brings Vlad back from the past along with several frightening experiences and inner visions. The acting is good and the movie is filmed on location in Romania where Vlad actually existed. Vlad is both historically accurate and a horror fantasy and is not your typical mindless horror film. This one is worth seeing and the musical score by Christopher Fields is fabulous."", 'There are more than too many Blood & Guts neck biting Vampire Movies out there. Thank you for not doing so in Vlad. And thank you for not showing Vlad boiling and impaling people. There was just enough violence in this one to get the point across. Great cast for an independent flick and very well done. I like the post graduate students as opposed to the overdone ""high school kids in distress and a stalker/killer/vampire in pursuit"". The musical score is awesome and the soundtrack more than likely will contain hits. Sellers and his crew continue to provide quality independent entertainment.My son is hoping there will be a Vlad video game.', 'I was much impressed with ""Vlad,"" and quickly voted it the best vampire movie I\'ve seen this decade. Now before I go on, let me apologize in advance to all the fans of Wes Craven for what I am about to say. I did not like ""Dracula 2000,"" or it\'s sequels. ""Vlad"" is a movie that gives me what I want when I watch a vampire movie. It has all the elements I like (crave) about the spooky Gothic style of the classic vampire. This includes sex, which in a vampire movie is not gratuitous, but part of the allure and mystique of the vampire. But where ""Vlad"" really delivers is in how well it maintains the constant atmosphere of mystery and apprehension. The music was perfect. Big points for spooky atmosphere. Also big points for including the historical Vlad Dracula, and, best of all, the location (what is it realtors say about location?) which is in his home country of Romania, and includes dramatic views of Bran Castle. For a B movie, this does exceptionally well. I was impressed with the special effects of the face transformations, which was subtle yet effective. It is indeed impressive how much work was put into a film with such a budget, and how fortunate they managed to film it on the historical grounds of Romania, and even include the people who live there. Anyone who can find fault with the acting knows nothing about acting. Did it have enough plot? Hell yes! And who can say the photography was not excellent? With apologies to Wes Craven fans, I say ""Vlad"" succeeds where ""Dracula 2000"" fails. As a fan of Bram Stoker, I am aware that this author\'s novel has NEVER been accurately told in film,(This includes the so called ""Bram Stoker\'s Dracula"") and that I must respect the right of an artist to make his own interpretation. But to make Dracula to be Judas Iscariot, I say, is taking too much liberty with artistic license. Not to mention that it lacks the Old World Gothic and darkly romantic mystique. For those who appreciate what a good vampire movie is, I say ""Vlad"" delivers.', ""This is one of the most underrated horror films of all time. 3.4 is just underrating it. I give it 10 out of 10. This is a Dracula sequel. Like most Dracula sequels it awesome. This is one of the scariest movie of all time. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. Dracula (March 1931) is better. Nosferatu (1922) is also better. Dracula (1992). If this movie does not scary you no movie will. This is better then Dracula (April 1931). It also a lot better then Nosferatu (1979) Dracula's daughter (1936) is better. Son of Dracula (1943) is better. This is better the Abbot and Costello meet Dracula. House of Frankenstein is better.

Los Angeles is on a transform plate boundary, which means that no volcanic activity will happen.

Featuring all manner of ""great"" special effects and autopilot performances from all concerned; Volcano subscribes to the classic \'disaster movie\' profile, and shows this further by ensuring that the plot makes about as much sense as blowing up your house to keep it from being robbed. Tommy Lee Jones struts his stuff as some bloke who works for the government, and Anne Heche gets down and dirty as someone who knows about volcanoes.

Quite how Tommy Lee Jones has managed to maintain a semi-respectable reputation after all these years is astounding. To me, his name has become synonymous with \'stupid load of rubbish\'. He might have the ability to portray a rugged action character, but he\'s unbelievably corny and doesn\'t make a good lead. Anne Heche stars opposite him and just does what you\'d expect the \'female with brains\' to do. Don Cheadle, who met with high acclaim after his performance in the massively overrated Hotel Rwanda, gives a very mundane performance, but I\'d still rather watch him than either of the two leads.

Unlike TITANIC, this one is on maximum horsepower without showing any important aspects to the story. We see tons of people roaming around, gigantic explosions, a large pack of flying helicopters, tall buildings collapsing, close calls from death by an inch, and all the more.

Tommy Lee Jones, who would give 110% making a McDonald\'s commercial, stars as Mike Roark, the hard-boiled head of the Office of Emergency Management, where he is assisted by his sidekick Emmit (Don Cheadle). After initially pooh-poohing the thought of a volcano in L.A. from geologist Amy Barnes (Anne Heche, who constantly ends her lines with a four-letter word like a period after a sentence), it\'s only a matter of time before he is proved wrong before his very eyes. Other solid performances come from Jacqueline Kim (Dr. Calder), John Carroll Lynch (Stan, the oft-maligned subway boss), and Keith David, a great actor who is otherwise wasted here in a role as a police lieutenant who has no impact on any events in the film, which is halfway over before he even appears on screen for the first time.However, there\'s the small problem of having something resembling a good story to go with the awesome visuals, which are indeed spectacular. But forget the volcano; Jerome Armstrong\'s script poses the greatest threat to the characters. To put it mildly, it\'s the biggest piece of cliché-ridden muck to come along in awhile, laden with plot holes, smarmy sentimentality (the offender here being a dog rescue scene near the beginning) and heroics, forced we-are-all-brothers morals, and implausibilities. Yes, this film is rooted far from reality, but it should make a little sense along the way.\nWorking at the OEM must be the cushiest job in the world, for all the employees do throughout the picture is holler at each other and stare blankly at computer monitors. (And why do they continuously show news broadcasts on their big screen? Is that where their disaster briefings come from?) Mike\'s sullen daughter (Gaby Hoffmann, in a thankless role in the tradition of ""True Lies"" and ""Face/Off""), due to her own incompetence, is suddenly thrust into peril and is thus separated from her father, a subplot that helps build up what turns out to be one great big joke of an ending. Describing it here can\'t do it justice. (After being taken to the hospital in Dr. Calder\'s Land Rover to receive treatment for a second-degree burn on her right leg, she is seen some time later with a bloody scab on her left cheek as she talks to Mike on the phone. And you thought your HMO was rough.) Plus, I seriously doubt that someone who jumps right into a pool of hot lava would slowly melt like a snowman in Miami while he screams and tosses the body of a man nearly twice his size to safety from a burning subway train. Then there\'s the wonderful family-oriented scene of two firemen burned alive in their overturned truck.And, lest we forget that ""Volcano"" takes place in L.A., there\'s the obligatory racist-cop episode in which a black man asking the fire chief to help his neighborhood is suddenly handcuffed out of nowhere by an officer for ""harassing"" him, a tacky scene complete with (groan) references to Rodney King and Mark Fuhrman. (The whole time he\'s cuffed, the black man makes carefree wisecracks to the officers all while his \'hood is burning to cinders.) But, of course, everything\'s eventually resolved. ""You\'re a good man,"" the other cop praises his partner after the latter grudgingly dispatches fire trucks to the black man\'s neighborhood, as if he has performed some immense display of generosity.In another lovely homage to L.A., there\'s also a looting scene, where extras run incredibly slow while carrying empty boxes.And what in the world was with the constant barrage of news reporters? Did we really need someone reporting ""The house behind me has just exploded into flames...all hell is breaking loose!"" while people were running for their lives all around her? As the volcano explodes out of the La Brea Tar Pits and lava is running onto the street, it\'s from a reporter describing this sight from where we hear one of the worst lines in the film: ""It\'s as if the tar had caught fire, melted and somehow expanded."" Hey, McFly, if tar is already a liquid to begin with, then how in the world can it melt?\nWhen an army of helicopters drops gallons of water on the lava blocked off on Wilshire, the reporters and camera crews, who are camped right up against the concrete barriers, manage to stay conveniently dry the entire time.Despite a high body count, scores of injured civilians and billions of dollars in damages, everybody\'s smiling as soon as a rainfall ensues, like those 7up commercials circa 1986. (""Feels so good comin\' down!"" Remember that?) Lots of questions are left unanswered: How will they clean up and repair everything? Will a future eruption occur soon? Will the Cubs win the World Series?Yet for all its pretentiousness and gaping flaws, I have to admit that ""Volcano"" was entertaining. It\'s a load of escapist camp that doesn\'t have a care in the world. And I do have to give credit where it\'s due; somehow the filmmakers managed to keep slow-moving lava exciting for 104 minutes.\nPlus, you can\'t help but get a kick out of a disaster film that includes the line ""This city\'s finally paying for its arrogance,"" and finds the time to include a Bible quotation. 7/10', 'I find it\'s impossible to write a review of a Mick Jackson movie without pointing out that in 1984 he shocked the nation of Britain with his nuclear holocaust docu-drama THREADS . Anyone who saw that on its BBC broadcast will never forget the grim , bleak , depressing and powerful depiction of the end of humanity . Seeing as THREADS was set in the Yorkshire town of Sheffield and filmed on a budget of what appeared to be three dollars fifty cents you\'d think he\'d use some of his unquestionable talent and VOLCANO\'s $90 million budget to make a convincing scenario of a city devastated by events beyond its control But Jackson has been there , done that , bought the T-Shirt and written his name in broadcasting history with THREADS and the last thing he wants is to make another grim shocker where millions of city dwellers die . Picking the dumbest script imaginable Jackson has decided he\'s going to enjoy himself this time and filmed the complete opposite to his nuclear holocaust horror show . Remember in THREADS a myriad of scientific advisers were used ? It goes without saying that no scientific bodies were consulted in the making of VOLCANO . Mind you this may actually work in the context of the story since the characters are so dumb , there is a logic to having a bunch of underground workers being burned to death and no one saying "" Hey these men were killed by lava . If we don\'t evacuate the city millions of people are going to be burned alive by a volcanic eruption "" Remember in THREADS after the bomb drops its everyman for himself ? That was probably the most terrifying thing about the docu-drama , of having your throat cut for your meager supplies of food . But not here where the guardians of law and order are not only noble enforcers of justice throughout the movie but also make sure no one is discriminated on the grounds of race and culture . You\'ve also got the feeling that if looters existed in this movie they wouldn\'t be shot but given a place on a counseling program There\'s also a similar aspect to the above . In THREADS people are left in the rubble to die since it\'s not practical to save them . Here the laws of physics have been changed so that if anyone is trapped under a burning truck a passer by can magically lift up the truck with one hand thereby rescuing the injured party . There\'s even a scene of self sacrifice that has to be seen to be believed , not that the scene was in any way believable to start with The English speaking world are obsessed with their pets and Jackson used this to harrowing effect in THREADS . We saw family pets suffocating in firestorms . If you didn\'t feel sorry for the human beings killed you\'d feel sorry for the poor animals . In VOLCANO we\'re treated to several scenes of pets in peril being rescued . I\'m not sure how many people die on screen but I\'m certain not one single type of mammal dies on screen apart from homo sapiens I don\'t believe for one moment that Mick Jackson\'s contrast between this and THREADS is coincidental - It\'s done entirely on purpose with the only connection being a scene of irony . In THREADS this takes the form of characters standing in front of a billboard advertising life insurance while in VOLCANO a character reads a book on writing screenplays . You won\'t need life insurance when the bomb drops while VOLCANO shows being able to read a book on screenplays doesn\'t mean you\'re capable of writing oneUnfortunately VOLCANO flopped at the box office and only made half its production costs in American cinemas which effectively ended Mick Jackson\'s successful Hollywood career which is shameful . I don\'t know about you but anyone who can direct two pieces of totally contrasting work is a literal genius in my opinion', ""I'm not going to pretend that this movie is realistic. It isn't. But if you want to just sit down and watch a film with action, drama and entertaining characters, then this is the film for you.Most disaster films are unrealistic, have no science behind them and if you think about them too much just get worse and worse. This movie is no exception. However, it is still a brilliant film if you want to sit down and not think too hard, or if you want to put a movie on without having to give it your full concentration. Personally, I think this film is great. There are better films out there, including better disaster films, but there are so many films that are ten times worse yet get better reviews. That's probably because they have better actors or are more realistic - but the job of a movie is to entertain, and this film does that brilliantly."", 'I have to say this is a big blockbustery KABOOM popcorny effects extravaganza, with a solid story, and good performances.

Scares me to think that some might actually believe what they saw in this movie.Even worse is the significant amount of talent that went into making this film. I mean the acting is actually very good. The effects are above average. Hard to believe somebody read the scripts for this and allowed all this talent to be wasted.

The purpose was to see how accurate the movie was. The volcanic activity that happened in the movie would never actually happen in real life, especially for the reason that they explained in the movie. Los Angeles is on a transform plate boundary, which means that no volcanic activity will happen. Volcanic activity can only result from convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries, or from a hot spot. From a movie standpoint, I thought that the movie was somewhat cheesy and predictable. At one point, one of my classmates predicted what the daughter was going to say before she even said it.', 'As a geology student this movie depicts the ignorance of Hollywood. In the scene where the dog grabs the bone from inside of the burning house, it is less then a foot from lava which has an average temperature of 1,750 degrees Fahrenheit. This stupidity is witnessed again when ""Stan"" goes to save subway 4. His shoes are melting to the floor of the subway while the rest of the team is standing just feet away from the flowing lava. And to finish off this monstrosity of a film, they come up with the most illogical solution, stopping a lava flow with cement K rails. Earlier in the film a reporters voice can be heard saying that nothing can stop the flow fire fighters have tried cars and CEMENT. Common sense dictates this film is a preposterous and gross understatement of human knowledge.', 'I\'m a reasonable man. When the title ""Volcano"" shows up on my TV screen, I know the score: this is a disaster movie.The formula dictates it contain archetypal characters, corny dialogue, a hefty dose of ""Hollywood science"", unbelievable behaviour, loose plots and half-arsed social commentary and if the director wasn\'t the kind to blindly follow formulae, he wouldn\'t be making a disaster movie in the first place.So, it should come as no surprise that Volcano includes all that in copious amounts. That\'s not what damns the movie.When you enter a disaster movie, you do so under the premise that all those groan-inducing ingredients will be drowned under an, if not entertaining, at least distracting buffet of jaw-dropping devastation. You willingly surrender plot, characters and realism on the altar of eye-candy; such is your tacit contract with the director.Mick Jackson doesn\'t uphold his end of the bargain: at first, we\'re served a silly but promising premise: the lava is sentient, throwing smouldering homing boulders at people and stores it just cannot tolerate. But after a burning (sorry) humiliation suffered at the hands of the scientist (she warns others of the homing properties of the boulders), the lava just gives up, it just flows at a snail\'s pace through the streets of LA, half-heartedly trying to catch the heroes before being relatively easily contained. Let this serve as a warning to anyone looking to make a volcano movie: when your lava loses the will to live, your audience loses interest.', ""A horrible mish mash of predictable story lines and toe-bendingly poor delivered PC clichés ad nauseam (races working together, the heroine being smart as well pretty, a guy sacrificing himself to save another life, a father/daughter relationship etc etc etc). The movie looks like something created for network television and should have probably stayed there. Even the gifted Tommy Lee Jones does not manage to salvage this BOMB. I urge you not to waste money or time on this cinematic ruin from the time when disaster-movies roamed Hollywood.The two stars are given solely to the CGI-people and the PR-peoples' ability to get even one movie-goer to sit through it."", ""Australian Free-to-air TV is in such a poor state that this movie was the best thing I could find tonight. This cliché-ridden piece seemed to have been written by 'my film student nephew' who 'has Final Draft on his computer' with the visual effects done by his mate who owns a pirated copy of After Effects. That's not to say that this film doesn't have its virtues. With a little extra modern day post-production this could be an excellent comedy instead of just an accidental one. Just have Mel Brooks tweak the script (not too much!), then CGI replace Tommy Lee Jones with Rick Moranis, give Anne Heche the voice of Joan Rivers and call it 'Lava Balls'."", 'A blockbuster with a colossal budget of $90 million according to IMDb, but everything rhymes with cheapness: the dialog, the script, the plot twists, the soundtrack, ... It looks like a tv movie we may watch during a rainy Saturday afternoon, with a bad cold.', 'There\'s been a movie made about almost every other type of natural disaster, so why not volcano\'s? Actually, why not make two movies? This big budget trash went up against that other big budget trash, Dante\'s Peak, back in 1997; and even though this one obviously had more to work with; it still managed to come off even shorter than Pierce Brosnan\'s dreary vehicle. Featuring all manner of ""great"" special effects and autopilot performances from all concerned; Volcano subscribes to the classic \'disaster movie\' profile, and shows this further by ensuring that the plot makes about as much sense as blowing up your house to keep it from being robbed. Tommy Lee Jones struts his stuff as some bloke who works for the government, and Anne Heche gets down and dirty as someone who knows about volcanoes. When a volcano erupts in Los Angeles (where\'d that come from?), it\'s up to these two (and a load of firemen etc) to stop the lava in its tracks before Tommy Lee Jones\' daughter is killed! Oh...and the rest of LA. The story is set up in the usual way; someone notices something, blah blah, he\'s ignored, blah blah, disaster happens, blah blah, the day is saved. Blah. Blah.This film is completely pointless, and is obviously only there for entertainment value. Still, even as entertainment, this falls flat on it\'s face. Obviously, in a film like this; you\'ve got to expect some over the top sequences and silly goings on (such as a sequence that sees a train worker save one of his friends...), but the film continually throws stupid ideas into the plot, and before long it just gets so silly that it\'s impossible to care about it. Quite how Tommy Lee Jones has managed to maintain a semi-respectable reputation after all these years is astounding. To me, his name has become synonymous with \'stupid load of rubbish\'. He might have the ability to portray a rugged action character, but he\'s unbelievably corny and doesn\'t make a good lead. Anne Heche stars opposite him and just does what you\'d expect the \'female with brains\' to do. Don Cheadle, who met with high acclaim after his performance in the massively overrated Hotel Rwanda, gives a very mundane performance, but I\'d still rather watch him than either of the two leads. On the whole, if you\'re going into this expecting some brainless fun; you\'ll be pleased to know that it is brainless, but unfortunately it\'s about as much fun as an actual volcanic eruption. Definitely NOT recommended.', ""BAD NEWS - Unlikeable female lead in Anne Hesch, who had too foul a mouth for me. Other irritating characters with stupid dialog. A predictable ending with the needlessly drawn out save-the-daughter scene trying for maximum suspense.GOOD NEWS - Some awesome disaster scenes. Hollywood's special-effects just keep getting more awesome as the years go on. A fast-moving story that was just about the right length. A likable lead character played by Tommy Lee Jones.Overall, a movie that keeps your attention but doesn't get your respect with the dumb dialog."", ""Well this is just a very average film stuffed full of the usual mainstream disaster genre clichés. Even myself as a staunch defender of the genre can not bring myself to rate it above average, because sadly it is something of a wasted opportunity. The film's cast is full of very reliable and solid performers, the budget was there to bring out some daring sequences, and of course the basic community in peril plot is always one of interest. So to get anything from this film you really do have to check the brain at the door and suspend all belief because the writers have rewritten the laws of gravity and the intensity of molten lava in full flow.The film would compete with Dante's Peak in the same year for the title of best Volcano disaster film, it lost, but so did the fans of the genre. For even today we are still waiting for a Volcano based film to grip and excite us, because even with the advance of technology both 1997 Volcano movies teeter on the brink of boredom, even if they just about fail to actually tip into the abyss. 5/10"", 'Can you say ""Box Office Disaster""? As in what you\'ve just seen in VOLCANO? I knew you would! A movie that gives us the works in special effects and a huge cast of firemen and police officers, it feeds on our appetites for a nonstop panic of disaster. All that\'s missing here is the plot, turning this grade-A visual feast into another ordinary B-movie. We pay the price for expensive graphics, and very little to keep us on the edge of our seats. Unlike TITANIC, this one is on maximum horsepower without showing any important aspects to the story. We see tons of people roaming around, gigantic explosions, a large pack of flying helicopters, tall buildings collapsing, close calls from death by an inch, and all the more. How about ripping off THE BLOB or other vintage sci-fi schlockers, for crying out loud? I don\'t see how a slow stream of crawling lava can make a movie exciting, and not even the helping hands can help prevent this masterpiece of eye candy from being another average effort.

And to finish off this monstrosity of a film, they come up with the most illogical solution, stopping a lava flow with cement K rails. Earlier in the film a reporters voice can be heard saying that nothing can stop the flow fire fighters have tried cars and CEMENT. Common sense dictates this film is a preposterous and gross understatement of human knowledge.', 'I\'m a reasonable man. When the title ""Volcano"" shows up on my TV screen, I know the score: this is a disaster movie.The formula dictates it contain archetypal characters, corny dialogue, a hefty dose of ""Hollywood science"", unbelievable behaviour, loose plots and half-arsed social commentary and if the director wasn\'t the kind to blindly follow formulae, he wouldn\'t be making a disaster movie in the first place.So, it should come as no surprise that Volcano includes all that in copious amounts. That\'s not what damns the movie.When you enter a disaster movie, you do so under the premise that all those groan-inducing ingredients will be drowned under an, if not entertaining, at least distracting buffet of jaw-dropping devastation. You willingly surrender plot, characters and realism on the altar of eye-candy; such is your tacit contract with the director.Mick Jackson doesn\'t uphold his end of the bargain: at first, we\'re served a silly but promising premise: the lava is sentient, throwing smouldering homing boulders at people and stores it just cannot tolerate. But after a burning (sorry) humiliation suffered at the hands of the scientist (she warns others of the homing properties of the boulders), the lava just gives up, it just flows at a snail\'s pace through the streets of LA, half-heartedly trying to catch the heroes before being relatively easily contained. Let this serve as a warning to anyone looking to make a volcano movie: when your lava loses the will to live, your audience loses interest.', ""A horrible mish mash of predictable story lines and toe-bendingly poor delivered PC clichés ad nauseam (races working together, the heroine being smart as well pretty, a guy sacrificing himself to save another life, a father/daughter relationship etc etc etc). The movie looks like something created for network television and should have probably stayed there. Even the gifted Tommy Lee Jones does not manage to salvage this BOMB. I urge you not to waste money or time on this cinematic ruin from the time when disaster-movies roamed Hollywood.The two stars are given solely to the CGI-people and the PR-peoples' ability to get even one movie-goer to sit through it."", ""Australian Free-to-air TV is in such a poor state that this movie was the best thing I could find tonight. This cliché-ridden piece seemed to have been written by 'my film student nephew' who 'has Final Draft on his computer' with the visual effects done by his mate who owns a pirated copy of After Effects. That's not to say that this film doesn't have its virtues. With a little extra modern day post-production this could be an excellent comedy instead of just an accidental one. Just have Mel Brooks tweak the script (not too much!), then CGI replace Tommy Lee Jones with Rick Moranis, give Anne Heche the voice of Joan Rivers and call it 'Lava Balls'."", 'A blockbuster with a colossal budget of $90 million according to IMDb, but everything rhymes with cheapness: the dialog, the script, the plot twists, the soundtrack, ... It looks like a tv movie we may watch during a rainy Saturday afternoon, with a bad cold.', 'There\'s been a movie made about almost every other type of natural disaster, so why not volcano\'s? Actually, why not make two movies? This big budget trash went up against that other big budget trash, Dante\'s Peak, back in 1997; and even though this one obviously had more to work with; it still managed to come off even shorter than Pierce Brosnan\'s dreary vehicle. Featuring all manner of ""great"" special effects and autopilot performances from all concerned; Volcano subscribes to the classic \'disaster movie\' profile, and shows this further by ensuring that the plot makes about as much sense as blowing up your house to keep it from being robbed. Tommy Lee Jones struts his stuff as some bloke who works for the government, and Anne Heche gets down and dirty as someone who knows about volcanoes. When a volcano erupts in Los Angeles (where\'d that come from?), it\'s up to these two (and a load of firemen etc) to stop the lava in its tracks before Tommy Lee Jones\' daughter is killed! Oh...and the rest of LA. The story is set up in the usual way; someone notices something, blah blah, he\'s ignored, blah blah, disaster happens, blah blah, the day is saved. Blah. Blah.This film is completely pointless, and is obviously only there for entertainment value. Still, even as entertainment, this falls flat on it\'s face. Obviously, in a film like this; you\'ve got to expect some over the top sequences and silly goings on (such as a sequence that sees a train worker save one of his friends...), but the film continually throws stupid ideas into the plot, and before long it just gets so silly that it\'s impossible to care about it. Quite how Tommy Lee Jones has managed to maintain a semi-respectable reputation after all these years is astounding. To me, his name has become synonymous with \'stupid load of rubbish\'. He might have the ability to portray a rugged action character, but he\'s unbelievably corny and doesn\'t make a good lead. Anne Heche stars opposite him and just does what you\'d expect the \'female with brains\' to do. Don Cheadle, who met with high acclaim after his performance in the massively overrated Hotel Rwanda, gives a very mundane performance, but I\'d still rather watch him than either of the two leads. On the whole, if you\'re going into this expecting some brainless fun; you\'ll be pleased to know that it is brainless, but unfortunately it\'s about as much fun as an actual volcanic eruption. Definitely NOT recommended.', ""BAD NEWS - Unlikeable female lead in Anne Hesch, who had too foul a mouth for me. Other irritating characters with stupid dialog. A predictable ending with the needlessly drawn out save-the-daughter scene trying for maximum suspense.GOOD NEWS - Some awesome disaster scenes. Hollywood's special-effects just keep getting more awesome as the years go on. A fast-moving story that was just about the right length. A likable lead character played by Tommy Lee Jones.Overall, a movie that keeps your attention but doesn't get your respect with the dumb dialog."", ""Well this is just a very average film stuffed full of the usual mainstream disaster genre clichés. Even myself as a staunch defender of the genre can not bring myself to rate it above average, because sadly it is something of a wasted opportunity. The film's cast is full of very reliable and solid performers, the budget was there to bring out some daring sequences, and of course the basic community in peril plot is always one of interest. So to get anything from this film you really do have to check the brain at the door and suspend all belief because the writers have rewritten the laws of gravity and the intensity of molten lava in full flow.The film would compete with Dante's Peak in the same year for the title of best Volcano disaster film, it lost, but so did the fans of the genre. For even today we are still waiting for a Volcano based film to grip and excite us, because even with the advance of technology both 1997 Volcano movies teeter on the brink of boredom, even if they just about fail to actually tip into the abyss. 5/10"", 'Can you say ""Box Office Disaster""? As in what you\'ve just seen in VOLCANO? I knew you would! A movie that gives us the works in special effects and a huge cast of firemen and police officers, it feeds on our appetites for a nonstop panic of disaster. All that\'s missing here is the plot, turning this grade-A visual feast into another ordinary B-movie. We pay the price for expensive graphics, and very little to keep us on the edge of our seats. Unlike TITANIC, this one is on maximum horsepower without showing any important aspects to the story. We see tons of people roaming around, gigantic explosions, a large pack of flying helicopters, tall buildings collapsing, close calls from death by an inch, and all the more. How about ripping off THE BLOB or other vintage sci-fi schlockers, for crying out loud? I don\'t see how a slow stream of crawling lava can make a movie exciting, and not even the helping hands can help prevent this masterpiece of eye candy from being another average effort. Nice try, but it just doesn\'t work.', 'Watching Mick Jackson\'s disaster flick, in which the eponymous natural disaster wreaks havoc throughout Los Angeles, is like watching a 3 a.m. infomercial. It\'s such silly, mindless fluff, yet there\'s just something about it that keeps your eyes glued to the screen.""Volcano"" is admittedly well-cast and acted, despite a dreadful script and a plot whose summary could fit on a matchbook. Tommy Lee Jones, who would give 110% making a McDonald\'s commercial, stars as Mike Roark, the hard-boiled head of the Office of Emergency Management, where he is assisted by his sidekick Emmit (Don Cheadle). After initially pooh-poohing the thought of a volcano in L.A. from geologist Amy Barnes (Anne Heche, who constantly ends her lines with a four-letter word like a period after a sentence), it\'s only a matter of time before he is proved wrong before his very eyes. Other solid performances come from Jacqueline Kim (Dr. Calder), John Carroll Lynch (Stan, the oft-maligned subway boss), and Keith David, a great actor who is otherwise wasted here in a role as a police lieutenant who has no impact on any events in the film, which is halfway over before he even appears on screen for the first time.However, there\'s the small problem of having something resembling a good story to go with the awesome visuals, which are indeed spectacular. But forget the volcano; Jerome Armstrong\'s script poses the greatest threat to the characters. To put it mildly, it\'s the biggest piece of cliché-ridden muck to come along in awhile, laden with plot holes, smarmy sentimentality (the offender here being a dog rescue scene near the beginning) and heroics, forced we-are-all-brothers morals, and implausibilities. Yes, this film is rooted far from reality, but it should make a little sense along the way.\nWorking at the OEM must be the cushiest job in the world, for all the employees do throughout the picture is holler at each other and stare blankly at computer monitors. (And why do they continuously show news broadcasts on their big screen? Is that where their disaster briefings come from?) Mike\'s sullen daughter (Gaby Hoffmann, in a thankless role in the tradition of ""True Lies"" and ""Face/Off""), due to her own incompetence, is suddenly thrust into peril and is thus separated from her father, a subplot that helps build up what turns out to be one great big joke of an ending. Describing it here can\'t do it justice. (After being taken to the hospital in Dr. Calder\'s Land Rover to receive treatment for a second-degree burn on her right leg, she is seen some time later with a bloody scab on her left cheek as she talks to Mike on the phone. And you thought your HMO was rough.) Plus, I seriously doubt that someone who jumps right into a pool of hot lava would slowly melt like a snowman in Miami while he screams and tosses the body of a man nearly twice his size to safety from a burning subway train. Then there\'s the wonderful family-oriented scene of two firemen burned alive in their overturned truck.And, lest we forget that ""Volcano"" takes place in L.A., there\'s the obligatory racist-cop episode in which a black man asking the fire chief to help his neighborhood is suddenly handcuffed out of nowhere by an officer for ""harassing"" him, a tacky scene complete with (groan) references to Rodney King and Mark Fuhrman. (The whole time he\'s cuffed, the black man makes carefree wisecracks to the officers all while his \'hood is burning to cinders.) But, of course, everything\'s eventually resolved. ""You\'re a good man,"" the other cop praises his partner after the latter grudgingly dispatches fire trucks to the black man\'s neighborhood, as if he has performed some immense display of generosity.In another lovely homage to L.A., there\'s also a looting scene, where extras run incredibly slow while carrying empty boxes.And what in the world was with the constant barrage of news reporters? Did we really need someone reporting ""The house behind me has just exploded into flames...all hell is breaking loose!"" while people were running for their lives all around her? As the volcano explodes out of the La Brea Tar Pits and lava is running onto the street, it\'s from a reporter describing this sight from where we hear one of the worst lines in the film: ""It\'s as if the tar had caught fire, melted and somehow expanded."" Hey, McFly, if tar is already a liquid to begin with, then how in the world can it melt?\nWhen an army of helicopters drops gallons of water on the lava blocked off on Wilshire, the reporters and camera crews, who are camped right up against the concrete barriers, manage to stay conveniently dry the entire time.Despite a high body count, scores of injured civilians and billions of dollars in damages, everybody\'s smiling as soon as a rainfall ensues, like those 7up commercials circa 1986. (""Feels so good comin\' down!"" Remember that?) Lots of questions are left unanswered: How will they clean up and repair everything? Will a future eruption occur soon? Will the Cubs win the World Series?Yet for all its pretentiousness and gaping flaws, I have to admit that ""Volcano"" was entertaining. It\'s a load of escapist camp that doesn\'t have a care in the world. And I do have to give credit where it\'s due; somehow the filmmakers managed to keep slow-moving lava exciting for 104 minutes.\nPlus, you can\'t help but get a kick out of a disaster film that includes the line ""This city\'s finally paying for its arrogance,"" and finds the time to include a Bible quotation. 7/10', 'I find it\'s impossible to write a review of a Mick Jackson movie without pointing out that in 1984 he shocked the nation of Britain with his nuclear holocaust docu-drama THREADS . Anyone who saw that on its BBC broadcast will never forget the grim , bleak , depressing and powerful depiction of the end of humanity . Seeing as THREADS was set in the Yorkshire town of Sheffield and filmed on a budget of what appeared to be three dollars fifty cents you\'d think he\'d use some of his unquestionable talent and VOLCANO\'s $90 million budget to make a convincing scenario of a city devastated by events beyond its control But Jackson has been there , done that , bought the T-Shirt and written his name in broadcasting history with THREADS and the last thing he wants is to make another grim shocker where millions of city dwellers die . Picking the dumbest script imaginable Jackson has decided he\'s going to enjoy himself this time and filmed the complete opposite to his nuclear holocaust horror show . Remember in THREADS a myriad of scientific advisers were used ? It goes without saying that no scientific bodies were consulted in the making of VOLCANO . Mind you this may actually work in the context of the story since the characters are so dumb , there is a logic to having a bunch of underground workers being burned to death and no one saying "" Hey these men were killed by lava . If we don\'t evacuate the city millions of people are going to be burned alive by a volcanic eruption "" Remember in THREADS after the bomb drops its everyman for himself ? That was probably the most terrifying thing about the docu-drama , of having your throat cut for your meager supplies of food . But not here where the guardians of law and order are not only noble enforcers of justice throughout the movie but also make sure no one is discriminated on the grounds of race and culture . You\'ve also got the feeling that if looters existed in this movie they wouldn\'t be shot but given a place on a counseling program There\'s also a similar aspect to the above . In THREADS people are left in the rubble to die since it\'s not practical to save them . Here the laws of physics have been changed so that if anyone is trapped under a burning truck a passer by can magically lift up the truck with one hand thereby rescuing the injured party . There\'s even a scene of self sacrifice that has to be seen to be believed , not that the scene was in any way believable to start with The English speaking world are obsessed with their pets and Jackson used this to harrowing effect in THREADS . We saw family pets suffocating in firestorms . If you didn\'t feel sorry for the human beings killed you\'d feel sorry for the poor animals . In VOLCANO we\'re treated to several scenes of pets in peril being rescued . I\'m not sure how many people die on screen but I\'m certain not one single type of mammal dies on screen apart from homo sapiens I don\'t believe for one moment that Mick Jackson\'s contrast between this and THREADS is coincidental - It\'s done entirely on purpose with the only connection being a scene of irony . In THREADS this takes the form of characters standing in front of a billboard advertising life insurance while in VOLCANO a character reads a book on writing screenplays . You won\'t need life insurance when the bomb drops while VOLCANO shows being able to read a book on screenplays doesn\'t mean you\'re capable of writing oneUnfortunately VOLCANO flopped at the box office and only made half its production costs in American cinemas which effectively ended Mick Jackson\'s successful Hollywood career which is shameful . I don\'t know about you but anyone who can direct two pieces of totally contrasting work is a literal genius in my opinion', ""I'm not going to pretend that this movie is realistic. It isn't. But if you want to just sit down and watch a film with action, drama and entertaining characters, then this is the film for you.Most disaster films are unrealistic, have no science behind them and if you think about them too much just get worse and worse. This movie is no exception. However, it is still a brilliant film if you want to sit down and not think too hard, or if you want to put a movie on without having to give it your full concentration. Personally, I think this film is great. There are better films out there, including better disaster films, but there are so many films that are ten times worse yet get better reviews. That's probably because they have better actors or are more realistic - but the job of a movie is to entertain, and this film does that brilliantly."", 'I have to say this is a big blockbustery KABOOM popcorny effects extravaganza, with a solid story, and good performances.

""Waiting To Exhale"", Forrest Whitaker\'s take on Terry McMillan\'s popular book, had a rather popular following upon it\'s release in 1995. It was packaged brilliantly, crossing over into the popular music scene with a blockbuster soundtrack featuring it\'s star Whitney Houston. However, as Leonard Maltin said it so beautifully, this film ultimately reminds one too much of the easy listening jazz that plays under nearly every scene.""Waiting To Exhale"" had the potential to be an interesting movie. It features a nice ensemble that manages to have good chemistry while also allowing certain performers to step into the limelight and really dominate certain scenes. Unfortunately, in the end, the movie is a repetitive drone.It tells the story of four African-American females (played by Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Divine, and Lela Rochon) as they struggle to find the men in life that can satisfy there needs. The only problem, in the world of this movie, men are nothing but complete ass-holes who wouldn\'t know the word ""feelings"" if they looked it up in the dictionary. How can this film possibly go anywhere when it\'s screenwriters has made men so incredibly unredeemable that nothing can change.For the first 45 minutes, the film is slightly enjoyable. However, as it continues on into it\'s 2 hour and plus running time... it begins to feel like deja-vu. The women keep putting themselves in identical situations to those they\'ve experienced in the past... and as much as they talk about it in slow/sultry voice-overs, they don\'t seem to learn squat.It\'s like the soundtrack music. Slightly soothing, enjoyable, and easy to digest... but too slow and pointless to listen to for very long. ""Waiting To Exhale"" in the end is nothing more then a boringly pointless film that wastes the potential it had with the cast. Were the film given more of a focal point, and a more distinct narrative line, perhaps it could have been a good film. But everyone on board apparently missed the memo that... films are better when they have a plot and a purpose.... D ...', 'Angela Basset was good as expected, but Whitney has no Range as an actress.

If she wasn't a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting. IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops & horrible movies."", ""While this movie truly is bound to be more appealing to women than men, it is a touching story of four best friends.

Walk the Line,3.12,3.58,"['Drama', 'Music', 'Romance']","A chronicle of country music legend Johnny Cash's life, from his early days on an Arkansas cotton farm to his rise to fame with Sun Records in Memphis, where he recorded alongside Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Carl Perkins.",joy,"['Comparing ""Walk the Line"" to ""Ray"", is comparing night to day. Both are biopics of famous singers with troubled pasts, but the similarities end there. Phoenix\'s singing is akin to fingernails going down a chalkboard. Witherspoon saves what little is good in the film. Phoenix\'s acting is palpable, but as an entertainer, Cash was a singer, not an actor. As a Johnny Cash fan, listening to the music in this movie is arduous. Phoenix couldn\'t carry a tune in a bucket and fails miserably to hit any of Cash\'s famous low, soul gripping notes. Why the studio didn\'t dub over Phoenix as did Universal in most of ""Ray"" is truly dumbfounding. Foxx sang a few songs but for the most part, gave way to the authentic Ray Charles. The irony is, Foxx can sing. Phoenix butchers the Man in Black\'s warmly cold, rumbling deep sounds that made Cash legendary. When Sam Phillips of Sun Records asks ""Cash"" in the movie ""if (he) only had one song to sing, what would it be,"" Phoenix lumbers into a drolling off-key rendition of Folsom Prison as could only be worsened by American Idol\'s William Hung.', ""Although there were a few touching moments, this biopic would have been infinitely better if there were different actors in the lead roles. I don't know who, but definitely NOT Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, who just tried too darn hard in this film. Although Joaquin Phoenix gave it his best shot, he just didn't have Johnny's look. As for Reese Witherspoon, she's been in too many perky blonde girl movies that this one just made her a perky brunette and she got to pout a little. If this is the best that Hollywood had to offer in recreating the legend that is Johnny Cash from an actors point of view, then the movie industry is in a whole lot of hurt. Oscar Contender? In this year of generally crappy movies, why not? Hollywood wonders why that they're having such a bad year at the box office. Walk the Line is a prime reason why. This is a serious picture, Oscar Worthy Picture? C'mon!"", ""I'll make this short and sweet, neither of which this film was. Bottem line, just another relationship movie. The acting was fair, the direction and photography were good, and yet I was grateful when this film finally came to a close. I found this to be a poor tribute to a musical legend. I am a big Johnny Cash fan, I grew up listening to him. To tell the truth I feel a little cheated on this one. I was hoping to at least hear some Jonny Cash music. Instead you get a couple of hours of someone else's idea of what Jonny Cash sounded like. If you're interested in relationship movies then you'll probably enjoy this one. If your not, pass."", 'I went to a screening of this movie at ""The Toronto Film Festival"" in anticipation of seeing something wonderful based on all the early reviews of this film....particularly for the performance of Joaquin Phoenix. The film begins with Cash getting ready for his performance at Fulsom prison in the late 60\'s and we then proceed to the telling of his story with a formulaic flashback to his childhood ... proceeding thru his career, marriage and relationship with June Carter. The storytelling and direction is unoriginal. Within the confines of the story this movie was trying to tell...I felt that the director could have shown us some moments of brilliance or originality...but chose a very conventional style instead.As for the performances....Joaquin does some good acting here but for the most part a ""one note"" performance. He does an admirable job at singing the Cash songs but I felt the film should have kept the original recordings since Cash had such a signature style and I found it hard to accept Joaquin singing them. I think lip-syncing like Foxx did in Ray would have worked better. The best performance of this film belongs to Reese Witherspoon. Her performance as June Carter is charming and she shines in every scene she is in. I was pleasantly surprised. I am positive she will get a nomination for an Oscar for this role and she has enough screen time for the lead category. Reese and Joaquin as Carter and Cash have a wonderful chemistry. The interaction and dialogue between these two was very enjoyable. Overall good performances in an unoriginal formulaic biopic.', ""Rarely has a biopic film made such a racket at the box office. After viewing the DVD version of WALK THE LINE the reasons for that success must be attached to some sort of homage to Johnny Cash, an American icon of sorts. Yes, his life and career are notable - the emergence of a legendary Country Western singer out of the elements of a warped childhood peaked by the accidental death of his older brother whom the father clearly preferred, and the torture of self doubt that haunted a man through an unsuccessful marriage and a thwarted love for fellow Country Western singer June Carter, his descent into alcohol and drugs, and his final victory over his demons - but isn't this the same story we see almost annually about famous stars whose backgrounds seem templates from this same mold? Joaquin Phoenix is a fine actor and has the courage to take on a variety of roles, succeeding in them all. And yes, he was able to sound like Johnny Cash (given the fact that even Cash's fans will admit it was not a voice of quality but of message). Much the same could be said for Reese Witherspoon's tackling successfully the equally mediocre quality voice of June Carter - again it was her sassy style that made her a star, not her voice. And perhaps that is the reason the writers and director elected to spend most of the screen time on the singing and concerts of Cash and Carter - leaving very little of the story of Cash's life except to outline form between songs.But if you condensed the actual acting time on the screen it falls into the overly familiar family clashes, drunken bouts, weaning off drugs, spats and eventual public displays of feelings that seem to be the formula for this genre of biopic. Though Phoenix and to an extent Witherspoon do well with the material they are given, does the result merit Oscar attention? That is up to the voters. It seems to this viewer that there have been many finer performances by less publicized actors in the smaller films more worthy. But then what are the Oscars for if not for PR for the movies. Just not that impressed. Grady Harp"", 'I don\'t know about ""Mangold the Auteur"", and might need a bit more proof that this is really a director worth paying attention to, but this is a pretty watchable film. I found the story and film-making a bit predictable, like the usual bio-pic formula that you might expect if you\'ve seen, say, coal miner\'s daughter, or any other bio-pic of someone you love. What makes this movie stand out is the two lead performances. Reese is unbelievably convincing as June Carter Cash. She almost disappears into the role. And her singing! Who knew??? And Joaquin! We\'ve been waiting for him to deliver a really spectacular performance for some time, and this is finally it. I, for one, resisted the idea that ANYONE could portray the man in black, but he does a pretty fine job. Not just an impersonation, but actually a performance worth watching. Really fine. Watch for the Jackson duet. Really awesome.', 'Whenever I see so much ""Oscar worthy"" tags/blurbs in an ad campaign I get nervous, see Cinderella Man. Usually you look closely at the fine print and see that the esteemed critic lauding the film is Joe Schmoe from the One Stop Light Bugle Press in Buttcreek, Illinois or a low level flunky who just happens to work for the media conglomerate that is distributing the film. So my heart sank a little when a film I have been eagerly awaiting was swaddled with such praise when the ads hit the air.But they\'re right for once.Joaquin Phoenix wears Johnny Cash like a suit. He isn\'t doing a Rich Little impersonation, you don\'t rub your eyes in disbelief, but he channels a man so distinct in appearance and voice to a level that is beyond admirable. One of the traits that made Johnny Cash a legend was that nobody sounded or looked like him. Short of a computer generated Cash walking around in his own bio-pic like one of those John Wayne beer commercials this is the definitive representation.And yet Phoenix may not give the best performance in the film.Reese Witherspoon more than holds up her end in a role that easily could have been reduced to a clichéd bumpkin. Witherspoon portrays the on-stage June in the way June portrayed her own ""character"", the stage persona that people adored, while giving her the resolve and inner strength to be the woman who tamed a hell-bent, grizzly bear of a man like John.The chemistry of Phoenix and Witherspoon together in any scene, but their on-stage duets in particular, are truthful in a way that resonates long after the credits. I know that unless you have been living in a cave for the past week you have likely been bombarded with the word that the actors sing themselves without use of lip syncing. I have never been a fan of musicals, or even musical performances in a film. They generally seem forced and uncomfortable to me, the moment when I stop experiencing the story and feel reminded that I am watching a movie. I never felt that in this film. I never felt that their singing took the focus of the film, but the performances work with the story like no other music bio I have ever seen. I never felt as if I was being led through the catalog, the songs felt as organic and natural as any spoken dialog in a great narrative.This film far exceeded my expectations and afforded me the first trip home from a theater with a true feeling of satisfaction in a very, very long time. Highly recommended.', '""Walk the Line"" is without question the zenith of Reese Witherspoon\'s acting career thus far. Joaquin Phoenix IS Johnny Cash in this biopic, but Reese as June Carter Cash sets this film on fire. It is one thing to portray a person\'s life, with feeling and emotion, something which Joaquin pulls off effortlessly. However, it is quite another to make a portrayal bigger than life, and Reese makes June Carter Cash the central character of this film.To say that Reese steals the show is an understatement. Reese becomes a lightning rod for Joaquin\'s character, in a way that is actually quite scary. After all, Reese is from Nashville, and her Southern affect is flawless and absolutely winning. Suffice it to say that Reese will thankfully be present when the Academy Awards are presented next year. She might want to get a few words ready.This movie will not be everyone\'s favorite flick, if for no other reason than that it is a biopic of flawed, Southern characters. However, perhaps the very flaws that imbue these characters with vitality and realism can establish the acting of Joaquin and Reese with an almost spiritual meaning, as they live these real people on screen. But in the final analysis, Reese Witherspoon will become the greatest contemporary screen actor upon release of this film. See for yourself. You read it here first.', 'The 1950s was an important period for the popular music that was being created in this country. It was the decade that brought forth the likes of Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, June Carter, Patsy Cline, Bob Dylan and the rest of those innovators that sent the popular music of that era to the stratosphere. The music was created by poor rural people that grew up hearing the blues and gospel music in church and at home. The white music stars stole shamelessly from the black artists they admired, but because of the racial climate in the land, they had no chance to make it as big as the white performers.Johnny Cash was an important figure that came out of that time. As portrayed in ""Walk the Line"", the biographic picture created by its director, James Mangold, and his collaborator, Gill Dennis, they present us an aspect of the man as he was starting in the music business as he goes from poverty and tragedy, early in life, to become one of the most influential exponents of the music that came out of Memphis in the fifties.The film showcases Johnny Cash and his involvement with June Carter, a figure that was legendary in her own right, and through her family which was involved in music. The film shows a man who had the talent, the charisma and the good looks to make it big in the music world with his own material. The film concentrates in the life of Mr. Cash and Ms. Carter prior to their marriage as their lives interconnected with one another because they traveled in the same circuit and usually paired in a lot of those venues. Theirs was a relationship that started on a friendly basis until Johnny messes his life and his marriage to the patient Vivian because he falls in love with June. On the other hand, June didn\'t want to get involved with a married man and was battling her own demons.The best excuse for seeing the film is the terrific performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, who, as Johnny and June, make this film come alive and make the viewer enter their world. Both actors do some of the best work in the movie. In fact, it was a surprise as how well these two dissimilar actors blend so well together, no mean feat for director Mangold.The film offers some of the best songs associated with Johnny Cash. The best part, and the wisest decision for the movie makers, was to let Mr. Phoenix sing the classic songs in his own way. Joaquin Phoenix, who has a good singing voice, also bears an uncanny resemblance with Mr. Cash. Reese Witherspoon makes a splash playing and singing songs that Ms. Carter made famous, although she was eclipsed by the stronger personality of Mr. Cash.The film will not disappoint thanks to the great treatment James Mangold gave the film.', ""I had a chance to see a pre-screening of Walk the Line a few days ago. Ultimately, it was a solid Hollywood film with great performances by Reece Witherspoon & Joaquin Phoenix. Yet, being a die-hard Johnny Cash fan from Arkansas, I was hoping for more on his development as a musician & struggle with his Christian faith. His faith in God & roots in gospel music carried him from childhood throughout his career. Johnny Cash made scores of records recalling scripture & hymns he found solace in his darkest hours. If you want to understand the context of his conflicts, you simply cannot leave faith out of the equation. I was left in want for the texture of the South which I grew up in, where people are as in touch with their surroundings as they are with themselves. In the film, Undertow, there's a beautiful three minute monologue about chiggers as a child sits barefoot on a riverbank. Perhaps taking cues from Terence Malick, John Boorman or David Gordon Green might have helped capture the subtlety which could have made this film truly great."", 'Forget North Country, Walk the Line directed by James Mangold (Girl Interrupted) and written by Mangold and Gill Dennis is the better 2005 Oscar contender.This romantic tragedy, which is based on the autobiographies of Johnny Cash The Man in Black and Cash: the Autobiography was actually written and perfected alongside the famous duo Cash and June Carter Cash before their deaths in 2003.The movie begins with a young, music obsessed ""J.R."" Cash growing up in a poor cotton farming family in Arkansas. Shortly afterwards, a family tragedy changes his life forever.Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) leaves for the air force, where he is stationed in Germany, buys an old guitar and proceeds to write one of the most recorded songs in history along with many others.Upon returning, Cash\'s obsession leads him to a recording studio and into the spotlight with June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) as well as Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton) and the comical Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne.) The next emotional hour and 45 minutes is filled with great music, drug dependency, infidelity, and most of all love.Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, who sang every song themselves, completely shined in this movie. There are no better actors that could have filled the shoes of the Carter-Cash duo. Phoenix and Witherspoon had such great chemistry, by the end of the movie you actually think they might really be in love.However, if you tend to get restless in longer movies, the running time of 136 minutes can start to seem a little long towards the end, but it\'s well worth it.Overall Walk the Line receives nine out of ten stars. The movie did an excellent job portraying the life of the ""man in black,"" his soul mate and their rocky path on the way to love. If Phoenix and Witherspoon are not nominated for their amazing voices and chilling performances, it will be a great disappointment.', 'Considering the formula junk coming out of Hollywood these days, I was blown away by how good this movie was. The direction was perfect. Using close ups to get us in under the skin of Johnny Cash. And since it was a period piece, he could have bored us with lots of cgi of Memphis and L.A. to take us back in time. Instead he used the actors and the music to take us there. Biopics naturally have a formula to them, but the director and screenwriter did not take us down the track of overly sentimental scenes. These were real and done with a bit of well placed humor. Just like real life. Afterall you still have to follow the real lives of Johnny and June. You can\'t make it up, just to be original! The movie was also a movie you can take most of the family to. No nudity and sex to SHOW how in love they are, just real dialog...it\'s nice to hear REAL dialog and not just another chase scene, or four letter word. Yes, some movies need that to tell the story, this one doesn\'t. This movie goes onto my short list of great biopics, with ""Ray"". Not much else comes close to Ray or Walk the Line. The true test of any biopics is: can you still understand the plot even if you never heard of the people the movie is about. This movie is a great love story even if you never heard of Johnny and June Cash. Oscars all around I say! Plus I loved the Rockabilly music through out the movie.']",12,"['Drama', 'Music', 'Romance']"

The wedding, the songs, the locations, it is impossible not to see the link between the two movies.Flawed as Mamma Mia was, at least it could rely on heavyweight actors like Meryl Streep, Colin Firth and Pierce Brosnan. The cast of this movie is nowhere near as good , and what the movie lacks in the embarrassingly simple plot, it fails to make up with chemistry and charm.This paper-thin feel-good movie no doubt hopes to cash in on its many similarities with worldwide hit movie Mamma Mia, and both movies basically works as advertisements for holidays in Italy, showcasing breathtakingly beautiful settings.All in all, the movie is not without its little charms and the 80s soundtrack surely appeals to many, so for an evening of feel-good fun this might just work for you, just don't expect any form of depth, thoughtfulness, cultural weight or lasting memories. I'm pretty sure you will have forgotten all about this movie in a couple of months."", ""I've just seen this movie and sadly I must say it failed to impress. The movie tried to copy Mammia Mia: songs throughout the movie, a wedding. Or maybe that's too much to say, it was more of a Glee-ish movie, with Bollywood influences. The storyline is very poor, but that was to be expected. You know how to story is going to unfold just by watching the trailer. What's worse is that most of the actors didn't seem to have chemistry with one another. Compared to Mammia Mia (it's almost impossible not to compare the two), it was kind of bad. In Mamma Mia at least the song choices where chosen right and they fit in the storyline. In Walking On Sunshine the song choices and moments weren't always chosen right. Most of the time those moments were awkward and out of place.

But for the most part, it was just weird. Even some of the funny scenes went on too long and got to be awkward. The ""story"" (if you can call it that) was predictable. The jokes were not, because they were so outlandish that they came across as gimmicky.Not that a movie like this requires great acting skills, but the roles played by Rudd, Aniston and Watkins are at least believable. But the credibility stops there. Most of the other characters are over-acted, and poorly-developed.And one of my biggest pet peeves: scenes from the trailer were NOT in the film. THIS DRIVES ME MAD! It\'s like a restaurant advertising a lunch special that they don\'t have in stock.Bottom line: save your movie, and save your time.', '""Wanderlust"" is about a young New York couple who are suddenly left with no income and need to find a place to live. On the way to Atlanta, they come across a love commune and end up staying for a while. This movie is filled with failed attempts at humor, don\'t get me wrong, some parts are genuinely funny, but most of it seems like they tried too hard to get a laugh. The main redeeming quality of ""Wanderlust"" is Paul Rudd\'s performance. His character counter-acted the rest of the cast\'s mediocre comedy. Overall I think it is an interesting story line with a lot of potential that simply fell a little flat. I would definitely suggest waiting for this one to come out DVD and saving the ten dollars.', ""WANDERLUST - 5/10.Being as I am more than fond of both Judd Apatow (Producer) and Paul Rudd (Lead Actor/Co. Producer) I was extremely eager to watch Wanderlust but came out of it disappointed and honestly quite shocked by the fact that Apatow had produced something so mediocre!That being said I did laugh in this film on quite a few occasions actually, in particular the mirror scene which was to say the least hilarious. In my opinion it was these rare moments of overstated humour and light satire which made the film bearable. Another strong point is the running time; thankfully this film doesn't drag on too much to the point where it becomes tedious.Rudd is consistently brilliant in nearly every release he has been in and Wanderlust is certainly no exception, but the person that stole the show for me personally was Joe Lo Truglio as Wayne the nudist novelist. I feel that in previous films Truglio has shined, never having a large part but still managing to have a huge impact on the overall humour of a film, notable examples are Kuzzick in Role Models (also alongside Rudd and director David Wain) and my personal favourite Lonnie in I Love You, Man (again, alongside Rudd). I feel that Truglio has this same effect in Wanderlust and that he played one of the more likable and overall interesting characters amongst a cast that is generally dull.Jennifer Aniston tries. Everything she does in this film comes off as a bit too eccentric, for example the weird acid trip she has just felt awkward and kind of unnecessary. The only thing that the does to a truly good standard is playing the 'un-employed go-getter living in the midst of a bustling Manhattan' but to be fair this sort of role has got to be second nature for her. Frankly the more in-your-face kind of comedy is a little out of Aniston's comfort zone and this does show a bit in Wanderlust.A lot of other reviews are advising you not to watch it but I disagree based on the fact that you could definitely do a lot worse. You should especially watch this if you enjoyed Wain's Wet Hot American Summer being as both films share a light form of satire. Wanderlust does not match Wet Hot American Summer in terms of overall comedy but I feel that the two are still comparable. Sure, nothing in Wanderlust is worth writing home about (apart from maybe the mirror scene which truly is, hilarious) and it is fairly forgettable but if you are ever in the mood for something light-hearted not to be taken too seriously kind of film then you can't go wrong with Wanderlust."", 'Whether good or bad, love or hate, movies should always elicit a reaction; the stronger the better in my book. When I come out of a theater, I want to have an opinion of the film I just saw and I want to be bubbling over with comments to process and compile into a review. As such, one of the worst traits a film can have is a lack of noteworthy content. If I cannot muster up a few hundred words on a given film, then I can\'t exactly give a hearty recommendation. Such is the case with Wanderlust. Life isn\'t going well for George (Paul Rudd) and Linda (Jennifer Aniston). Just days after paying too much for a small New York apartment, George\'s company goes under and Linda\'s new business idea is wrecked. Jobless and penniless, the couple heads to Atlanta where George has a job waiting for him, courtesy of his obnoxious older brother (Ken Marino). On the way down, however, they stop in at a remote bed and breakfast which turns out to be a commune. Led by a charismatic free spirit named Seth (Justin Theroux), this group of hippies have embraced a simpler way of life that comes complete with all the amenities and ideals you might expect of such a community. Intrigued by the happiness the group exudes, George and Linda decide to move into the commune for a two-week trial run. Shenanigans ensue.Most of what I liked about Wanderlust boiled down to my affection for the leads, Rudd and Aniston. Rudd is one of the most likable, perpetually enjoyable comedic actors in the field today and he always manages to come across as a bright spot even in a bad movie. I think Rudd\'s charm comes as a result of his ability to bridge the gap between nerd and cool guy; he doesn\'t exactly belong in either camp and yet can walk in both. As always, Rudd gives an endearing and appealing performance here and exudes a natural, everyman charisma. I\'m pretty sure several of the funnier scenes within Wanderlust are the product of Rudd\'s improvised banter and as such, this film owes a great deal to its star. Aniston, too, is a favorite of mine (despite some of truly terrible films) who has proved to possess a comedic touch when given something to work with. Her chemistry with Rudd is solid and while her role isn\'t as well developed as Rudd\'s, she does her job well and the pair makes for a solid combination. The other elements of Wanderlust, however, are lackluster. The narrative contains a few promising story lines but they aren\'t fleshed out with much pizazz. There are plenty of laughs but most of them come from easy, ""low hanging fruit""-type jokes that get old as the film progresses. And most of the supporting characters are as one-note as they come; each brings a few laughs here and there when they\'re in their respective elements but then run out of gas and become tiresome. Theroux, Malin Ackerman, Kathryn Hahn, and several others have their moments but none of them ever really get moving or show any signs of development. This lack of depth and development results in the feeling that Wanderlust is not so much a film as it is a bundle of individual scenes, vignettes if you will, tied together by George and Linda in loose, unsatisfying fashion.There\'s nothing inherently or irrevocably wrong with Wanderlust but outside of a few laughs and the appeal of the leads, there\'s nothing truly right about it, either. It simply is and that lack of significance makes for an overly ho-hum experience.Please see my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com', ""This is an offensively bad movie or one that constantly annoyed me but there is just absolutely nothing about it that stands out or ever works out as anything truly great or hilarious.No, I really didn't get any laughs out of this movie, expect for the very random Ray Liotta cameo. For some reason Ray Liotta cameo's always make me laugh. But other than that, the movie is offering far too little laughs. It's all quite predictable and besides its moments often go on for far too long.Same goes for the entire movie. It just goes on and on, without making a clear point about anything. Seriously, the movie for the longest time is going absolutely nowhere and I still don't understand why this movie exists. It's one you can very easily do without.It's also definitely because of its premise that I just see this as a very pointless and a not all that great comedy. I just couldn't buy into its premise of city folks suddenly trying to live in a rural commune. For me there was no good reason why they even tried this and it really doesn't work out as anything convincing. I wish the movie would had done more with its story and characters, to at least make the movie a bit more amusing to watch.I honestly really like Paul Rudd but if he like him or any of the other actors in this movie, this is still not a good reason to go and see this movie. The material they all had to work what was just too weak and not all of the jokes seem to have been thought through thoroughly enough, probably because most of the movie its jokes came from the actor's improvising on the spot.Definitely not worth seeing, though it remains far from the worst stuff the genre has to offer.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"", 'My room mates watched this flick, told me it was worth a watch but nothing special.Full disclosure: I am a huge David Wain fan, I loved Stella, I watch Wainy Days, etc.This movie is about two city types who have a run of bad luck, end up at hippie commune.

This starts with great promise as a satire of American society - epitomized by the wonderfully crass, materialistic brother - with some great laugh-out loud moments as the American dream goes wrong for Judd and Aniston. The humour is often off-beat and at times anarchic, such as when the horse appears in the couple's doorless room at the commune. Ultimately though, it just wants to poke fun at everyone and loses the plot, ending up as the formulaic rom-com it promised not to be. You really get the feeling this is an intelligent script put through the studio wringer. Judd's mirror scene is a weird low point, proving that improvisational riffing is often just a self-indulgent waste of screen time. If full-frontal male nudity (one of the commune's main characters is a perpetual nudist) and off-beat attempts at satire offend, you won't like this, but there are good laughs to outweigh the flaws."", ""So, I saw Wanderlust the day it opened.

I thought Justin Theroux was really good as a hippy-ish guy, trying to make Jennifer Aniston love him. And lets face it, this will be the closest we will ever get to see Jennifer Aniston boobs, okay? So, stop complaining, it will NEVER happen. Best comedy ever? Hell no.

Not a single actor, line or scene disappointed me. Yes there was some awkward moments and characters, but hell, what's a comedy without that? It didn't censor itself but rather embraced it's originality; and that's why I think I enjoyed it so much.

I pay attention to the audience as well, every where, spontaneous laughter, the nudity shocking but not offensive.

If that was where the laughs came from, maybe the movie would make a little sense.

An alleged comedy, co-written, directed, and produced by David Wain--who apparently had help, though it doesn't show. Full of loathsome, offensive characters and jokes, edited in a sledgehammer fashion. Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston do have some appealing moments in the film's opening, but it's a long road downhill from there, what with an abundance of in-your-face toilet humor which may have been somewhat more successful had the rest of this disaster not been covered in flop sweat. * from ****"", ""I've read the reviews from others and I must have been watching another movie because the one I saw was absolutely awful... there were 6 people in the movie when it started and none after about 3/4ths of it...

I think that once she sits down and watches it she will see that there really is nothing funny about this movie... even the premise is flawed.. who lives in a commune nowadays.. do the producers really expect us to believe that two city slickers from New York would pack everything up and drive down to Atlanta after losing a job?? and who in their right mind would go to a place like this anyway??This movie will go down as one of the worst of the year and the ones that reviewed it favorably and thought it was funny,well I'm not sure about them"", ""My husband and I do enjoy comedies.

Other than that, we were sorry that we bothered to attend the screening. And there was no reason for having Alan Alda in the movie at all. My husband and I kept looking at each other as so many people around us were laughing throughout the movie. I am so glad that I didn't pay for this and would love to have the hours back that we wasted on line and viewing it."", 'Yes, there were a couple good laughs to be had during this movie. But for the most part, it was just weird. Even some of the funny scenes went on too long and got to be awkward. The ""story"" (if you can call it that) was predictable. The jokes were not, because they were so outlandish that they came across as gimmicky.Not that a movie like this requires great acting skills, but the roles played by Rudd, Aniston and Watkins are at least believable. But the credibility stops there. Most of the other characters are over-acted, and poorly-developed.And one of my biggest pet peeves: scenes from the trailer were NOT in the film. THIS DRIVES ME MAD! It\'s like a restaurant advertising a lunch special that they don\'t have in stock.Bottom line: save your movie, and save your time.', '""Wanderlust"" is about a young New York couple who are suddenly left with no income and need to find a place to live. On the way to Atlanta, they come across a love commune and end up staying for a while. This movie is filled with failed attempts at humor, don\'t get me wrong, some parts are genuinely funny, but most of it seems like they tried too hard to get a laugh. The main redeeming quality of ""Wanderlust"" is Paul Rudd\'s performance. His character counter-acted the rest of the cast\'s mediocre comedy. Overall I think it is an interesting story line with a lot of potential that simply fell a little flat. I would definitely suggest waiting for this one to come out DVD and saving the ten dollars.', ""WANDERLUST - 5/10.Being as I am more than fond of both Judd Apatow (Producer) and Paul Rudd (Lead Actor/Co. Producer) I was extremely eager to watch Wanderlust but came out of it disappointed and honestly quite shocked by the fact that Apatow had produced something so mediocre!That being said I did laugh in this film on quite a few occasions actually, in particular the mirror scene which was to say the least hilarious. In my opinion it was these rare moments of overstated humour and light satire which made the film bearable. Another strong point is the running time; thankfully this film doesn't drag on too much to the point where it becomes tedious.Rudd is consistently brilliant in nearly every release he has been in and Wanderlust is certainly no exception, but the person that stole the show for me personally was Joe Lo Truglio as Wayne the nudist novelist. I feel that in previous films Truglio has shined, never having a large part but still managing to have a huge impact on the overall humour of a film, notable examples are Kuzzick in Role Models (also alongside Rudd and director David Wain) and my personal favourite Lonnie in I Love You, Man (again, alongside Rudd). I feel that Truglio has this same effect in Wanderlust and that he played one of the more likable and overall interesting characters amongst a cast that is generally dull.Jennifer Aniston tries. Everything she does in this film comes off as a bit too eccentric, for example the weird acid trip she has just felt awkward and kind of unnecessary. The only thing that the does to a truly good standard is playing the 'un-employed go-getter living in the midst of a bustling Manhattan' but to be fair this sort of role has got to be second nature for her. Frankly the more in-your-face kind of comedy is a little out of Aniston's comfort zone and this does show a bit in Wanderlust.A lot of other reviews are advising you not to watch it but I disagree based on the fact that you could definitely do a lot worse. You should especially watch this if you enjoyed Wain's Wet Hot American Summer being as both films share a light form of satire. Wanderlust does not match Wet Hot American Summer in terms of overall comedy but I feel that the two are still comparable. Sure, nothing in Wanderlust is worth writing home about (apart from maybe the mirror scene which truly is, hilarious) and it is fairly forgettable but if you are ever in the mood for something light-hearted not to be taken too seriously kind of film then you can't go wrong with Wanderlust."", 'Whether good or bad, love or hate, movies should always elicit a reaction; the stronger the better in my book. When I come out of a theater, I want to have an opinion of the film I just saw and I want to be bubbling over with comments to process and compile into a review. As such, one of the worst traits a film can have is a lack of noteworthy content. If I cannot muster up a few hundred words on a given film, then I can\'t exactly give a hearty recommendation. Such is the case with Wanderlust. Life isn\'t going well for George (Paul Rudd) and Linda (Jennifer Aniston). Just days after paying too much for a small New York apartment, George\'s company goes under and Linda\'s new business idea is wrecked. Jobless and penniless, the couple heads to Atlanta where George has a job waiting for him, courtesy of his obnoxious older brother (Ken Marino). On the way down, however, they stop in at a remote bed and breakfast which turns out to be a commune. Led by a charismatic free spirit named Seth (Justin Theroux), this group of hippies have embraced a simpler way of life that comes complete with all the amenities and ideals you might expect of such a community. Intrigued by the happiness the group exudes, George and Linda decide to move into the commune for a two-week trial run. Shenanigans ensue.Most of what I liked about Wanderlust boiled down to my affection for the leads, Rudd and Aniston. Rudd is one of the most likable, perpetually enjoyable comedic actors in the field today and he always manages to come across as a bright spot even in a bad movie. I think Rudd\'s charm comes as a result of his ability to bridge the gap between nerd and cool guy; he doesn\'t exactly belong in either camp and yet can walk in both. As always, Rudd gives an endearing and appealing performance here and exudes a natural, everyman charisma. I\'m pretty sure several of the funnier scenes within Wanderlust are the product of Rudd\'s improvised banter and as such, this film owes a great deal to its star. Aniston, too, is a favorite of mine (despite some of truly terrible films) who has proved to possess a comedic touch when given something to work with. Her chemistry with Rudd is solid and while her role isn\'t as well developed as Rudd\'s, she does her job well and the pair makes for a solid combination. The other elements of Wanderlust, however, are lackluster. The narrative contains a few promising story lines but they aren\'t fleshed out with much pizazz. There are plenty of laughs but most of them come from easy, ""low hanging fruit""-type jokes that get old as the film progresses. And most of the supporting characters are as one-note as they come; each brings a few laughs here and there when they\'re in their respective elements but then run out of gas and become tiresome. Theroux, Malin Ackerman, Kathryn Hahn, and several others have their moments but none of them ever really get moving or show any signs of development. This lack of depth and development results in the feeling that Wanderlust is not so much a film as it is a bundle of individual scenes, vignettes if you will, tied together by George and Linda in loose, unsatisfying fashion.There\'s nothing inherently or irrevocably wrong with Wanderlust but outside of a few laughs and the appeal of the leads, there\'s nothing truly right about it, either. It simply is and that lack of significance makes for an overly ho-hum experience.Please see my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com', ""This is an offensively bad movie or one that constantly annoyed me but there is just absolutely nothing about it that stands out or ever works out as anything truly great or hilarious.No, I really didn't get any laughs out of this movie, expect for the very random Ray Liotta cameo. For some reason Ray Liotta cameo's always make me laugh. But other than that, the movie is offering far too little laughs. It's all quite predictable and besides its moments often go on for far too long.Same goes for the entire movie. It just goes on and on, without making a clear point about anything. Seriously, the movie for the longest time is going absolutely nowhere and I still don't understand why this movie exists. It's one you can very easily do without.It's also definitely because of its premise that I just see this as a very pointless and a not all that great comedy. I just couldn't buy into its premise of city folks suddenly trying to live in a rural commune. For me there was no good reason why they even tried this and it really doesn't work out as anything convincing. I wish the movie would had done more with its story and characters, to at least make the movie a bit more amusing to watch.I honestly really like Paul Rudd but if he like him or any of the other actors in this movie, this is still not a good reason to go and see this movie. The material they all had to work what was just too weak and not all of the jokes seem to have been thought through thoroughly enough, probably because most of the movie its jokes came from the actor's improvising on the spot.Definitely not worth seeing, though it remains far from the worst stuff the genre has to offer.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"", 'My room mates watched this flick, told me it was worth a watch but nothing special.Full disclosure: I am a huge David Wain fan, I loved Stella, I watch Wainy Days, etc.This movie is about two city types who have a run of bad luck, end up at hippie commune.

Purely hilarious cast sans Paul Rudd, I\'m not a huge fan but I understand why people do.To the guy saying ""its unrealistic"": Hi, I\'m movies. Have you ever seen me before? Bottom Line: If you liked The State, Stella, Michael & Michael Have Issues, Children\'s Hospital, or the like. You will more than likely enjoy this movie.7 out of 10.', ""Not the usual rom-com formula you'd expect from the leads, which might explain the poor reviews here. This starts with great promise as a satire of American society - epitomized by the wonderfully crass, materialistic brother - with some great laugh-out loud moments as the American dream goes wrong for Judd and Aniston. The humour is often off-beat and at times anarchic, such as when the horse appears in the couple's doorless room at the commune. Ultimately though, it just wants to poke fun at everyone and loses the plot, ending up as the formulaic rom-com it promised not to be. You really get the feeling this is an intelligent script put through the studio wringer. Judd's mirror scene is a weird low point, proving that improvisational riffing is often just a self-indulgent waste of screen time. If full-frontal male nudity (one of the commune's main characters is a perpetual nudist) and off-beat attempts at satire offend, you won't like this, but there are good laughs to outweigh the flaws."", ""So, I saw Wanderlust the day it opened. The trailers, as everyone knows, just looks stupid. But, the movie, being Judd Apatow and all, is not that stupid. George and Linda move to Atlanta for a better opportunity, until they stumble upon a love commune. Note: Love communes are not nudists communes. Though, there is a nudist. This movie has a good cast. I thought Justin Theroux was really good as a hippy-ish guy, trying to make Jennifer Aniston love him. And lets face it, this will be the closest we will ever get to see Jennifer Aniston boobs, okay? So, stop complaining, it will NEVER happen. Best comedy ever? Hell no. It is not a spectacular movie, but to me, it is just a refreshing movie that you can watch and laugh at after a hard day's work."", ""I can see why this is getting so much hate, it's definitely a tad vulgar and will offend the most sensitive, but hell i'd be lying if i don't say i laughed quite consistently.The tale of a new york couple that struggles with money and failure and finds themselves in a small hippie commune it's simple but heartfelt, Paul and Jennifer are quite good in this and move from serious to awkward with ease, being in my late 30's i could relate with their dilemma since i'm living through a similar f****d up system and the desire to leave everything behind.It's a comedy for adults so i didn't mind the more uncomfortable bits, there's a lot of nudity (sorry, no Paul or Jen, only ugly folks), I can't recommend it without reservations but I've had a good time."", ""I had to write a review for this movie because I read some reviews on this site before I watched it and was really debating on whether I should even see it, but my girlfriend insisted. I thought from other people's reviews that this movie was going to SUCK.However it didn't. Far from it, I actually found myself laughing the entire movie. Not a single actor, line or scene disappointed me. Yes there was some awkward moments and characters, but hell, what's a comedy without that? It didn't censor itself but rather embraced it's originality; and that's why I think I enjoyed it so much. So to anybody reading these reviews that are saying it's not funny, don't listen to them, give it a chance and I doubt you'll be disappointed. I sure as hell wasn't.And to any male readers discouraged by the fact that there is a male nudist in the movie, you can breathe easy- it's a prosthetic.All in all I'll give this movie a 9 because it's funny, original, kind of weird, and yet totally awesome."", ""I love the humor in this movie, it is very dry with subtle irony mixed in. It is a much better film than many critics have given it credit for. If you enjoyed Wet Hot American Summer, then you are sure to enjoy this one as well. Often, this type of humor can be missed if you take the movie too seriously.Rudd and Aniston work well together with plenty of other talent in the cast you'll likely recognize. But it is all the secondary characters that really keep this movie interesting. David Wain does an excellent job managing these characters as the movie plot can bring about dramatically different sets and character types."", 'If you remember the late 1960\'s this movie is really funny. I laughed all the way through and this is unusual for me. To find a really funny, intelligent comedy is rare and very welcome.There are some intense and somewhat ""uncomfortable"" moments but, to me, they were believable and gave the film some depth. I loved the way the characters dropped their facades in the final scenes - now that\'s a real ""truth-telling circle"". The juxtaposition of different cultures and personalities was written brilliantly. I expect that sociologists will have a blast with this film.I rented this, despite the low rating, because of Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd whom I consider to be wonderful comedic actors. It\'s great to see them together again.', ""Oh man, was this a fun movie. I didn't have high expectations when I decided to check out Wanderlust. I didn't know all that much about the movie.

He gets rid of his enemies one by one and tries to prove his innocence.,anger,"[""The movie is about a young man who finds out that his long lost father is an assassin who is killed and teams up his organisation to avenge him. Anyway let me get to the point this movie is absolutely horrible!!!! The only way I understood the story is by reading it not on the screenplay of the movie. The first half was so unacceptably bad that I felt like I'm in a car diving with no destination. At the start there was a birthday in an office then all of a sudden there was a useless sex scene. There were so many stupid and composite scenes and the filmmakers expect you to suddenly change your mood which is beyond irritating. The action was daft & unrealistic e.g. bullets that goes where you want them to go and shooting a bullet before it hits.The second half got a bit interesting and was going well but the ending was so bad that it just ruined the second half which was the only good part of the film. Personally I think that the beginning and the ending are the most important scenes of any movie because of the first and last impression and the beginning and the ending were the worst scenes of Wanted. There where also some questions that are left unanswered.Overall I Wanted to see this film when I seen the trailer and it totally turned out to be an Unwanted movie."", ""Definitely a great beer and pizza movie with some lazy friends on a Friday night, but a philosophical masterpiece about work, ennui, and nihilism, I think not.Look, the point is action is action and here the action is just fine. Unlike Crank, or Shoot'em up however it can't find a post modern humor to it, it just plays the action too straight and too improbable, and the word that spring to mind is bathos.However, philosophy is great only if really tight and not pop dollops of pseudo meaning - there is not enough explanation, it's all very mysterious, but simply not mystic enough.I would have liked less bullets and knives and more creativity in the action scenes - and finally at the end of the day the film can't cram in all we need to know in the time continuum provided.Good, if violent, entertainment, but a good film... uh huh.....no way."", 'For the first half hour Wanted felt like a trailer.Adapted from a graphic novel the film never seems to settle,the actors seem ill at ease with the material and the impatience on the directors part leaves us with a messy hackneyed film of action set pieces and sci fi mumbo jumbo inbetween. The film tries far too hard to be cool which is a shame because im sure it could have been a better film if things would have just been done with a little less haste.James McAvoy,so convincing in Last King Of Scotland is hard to like in this role.Morgan Freeman seems totally non interested but to be fair hes given virtually nothing to do and just serves as filler between action scenes.Angelina Jolie is the real star of this film,she has astounding presence as an actress and suits the action genre,its just a shame we cant find a truly memorable action film for her to star in.In summary Wanted is a fast paced but legless action film that promises much but delivers very little.It leaves you wanting.', 'So a friend told me how the book was very different from the movie, and made me read the book... and boy was he right. But more about that later...I recall seeing one of the producers say in an interview that due to all the superhero movies out, they intentionally went for a more ""realistic"" approach. I kept this in mind as I watched this movie. That said, I can only say that it\'s good, not great.James McAvoy, who I\'ve been a fan of since ""Rory O\'Shea Was Here"", does an acceptable job as the movie\'s main character. However, I couldn\'t help but notice his accent seem to be just a little off here and there, which was a little distracting for me. Morgan Freeman and Angelina put in some reliable, albeit unremarkable, roles. And Common, a guy who has more on screen gravitas than most actors, is sadly underused.The action scenes, which are vital for a film like this are very good. There are plenty of ""okay, that was pretty cool"" moments for adrenaline junkies out there. (Fyi: McAvoy actually did the ""on the car hood"" stunt with no CG. Nice job.) The story is good, but considering the original story, it would have been really hard to make a horrible movie. The special effects do a good job of making you believe in the unbelievable and some interesting camera-work and slow-mo also do well to enhance the experience.All in all, above average, but not outstanding. 6 out of 10 BONUS COMMENTARY: The real tragedy about this movie is what it COULD have been. The original comic book wasn\'t about him being an assassin, you see, it was about him training to be a supervillian! That\'s right, in a superhero world, he\'s the Green Goblin, or Lex Luthor, or even the Joker! Now imagine what that movie would have been like! Additionally, they had to train him to be a cold-hearted, homicidal, remorseless bad guy. The book, which is definitely not for kids, is chock full with so much f-you, in-your-face, unapologetic violence this version of the movie would have been looking at an R rating for sure. Anyway, if you get a chance, track down the book and have a read. You can thank me later.', ""Putting it bluntly, 'WANTED' was a rather formulaic and predictable outing. A loserly, office shut-in with the help of a hot babe learns about his past and is suddenly thrust into the world of assassination, a world of flipping cars, extreme gun fights, and mind-altering stunts, thus shedding every bit of his shy, weak self. This we've all seen before.Where 'WANTED' stands apart from any other action film I've seen is in its style. The director has upped the ante on how the action is portrayed. Gone are any sort of boundaries. This is a world where people can flawlessly flip cars over others and land perfectly upright on the other side, where people can shoot from miles away hitting nothing but their target, where people can put such a curve on bullets that they hit multiple targets standing on different planes all with one shot. If people can really do this, perhaps I'm living the same existence as Wesley, and I'm missing out. The film's major selling point is its style and its worth a viewing simply for that.The A-List cast delivers solid performances, but the script they are given - with the exception of the last line uttered in the film - is mostly generic. James McAvoy is sympathetic and relatable as the guy who is overwhelmingly bored with his life but doesn't know how to change it - something many people understand. His transformation into tough guy is effortless and convincing. Angelina Jolie is Fox - a name quite fitting as Jolie looks fantastic; however, we've seen this character on her before. Still, she does it well. Freeman, as usual, injects intelligence into his role, playing the solemn leader of The Fraternity.However, for all the edgy extreme events the film contains, the film is hurt by some pieces that are just plain odd and are never fully explained. For one, The Fraternity gets their targets from a secret code that is woven into tapestries by The Loom of Fate. Sounding like something from a Monty Python sketch, it is never revealed who - if anyone - controls the loom or where it derives its powers. Names are simply revealed through code and the members of The Fraternity don't ask questions. The members of The Fraternity are fully human, but seemingly invincible thanks to some sort of special wax bath devised to heal wounds very quickly. It's the film's easy out that allows them to deliver the goods on all the high-octane action they desire. Lastly, the film turns a very predictable corner that many will see coming from miles away.When the film ends you will realize how simple it is and how ridiculous it is about 75% of the time, but you won't care. The film makes up for every flaw by smearing the screen with mind-bending stunts, unique filmography, and breathtaking visuals - yes, Ms. Jolie is one of them. It will be painfully obvious that all the simple plot details were just the framework and the real substance of the film lies not in its intricate story, but in the execution of its stunts and action. 7/10."", 'I had a lot of expectations for this one. The visuals seemed stunning, the action heart-throbbing and the cast remarkable. And those thing were there but I just couldn\'t shake the feeling of this movie being nothing more than a paycheck.All the memorable dialog, scenes and concepts seemed all TOO familiar. The bullet cam was taken from the video game Max Payne, the keyboard to the face scene from an internet show called PurePwnage, the last line was also taken from a famous Bob Ross parody, the train cart scene was reminiscent of an old children\'s show based on a popular toy, and I could go on...I can look away and call them a coincidence but the last straw was the story. It was preposterously bad! Nothing made any sense, it seemed like they just pulled it out of a hat to house the action.

So you can expect a lot of over-the-top stunts, including the ability to curve bullet paths. Why there has been a lot of complaints about this aspect of the movie, I don\'t know. It\'s not really over-used and it adds a cool element to the movie. The film has PLENTY of action throughout, though most of my favorite scenes were during the course of Wesley\'s training with the Fraternity. The film also has a ""twist"" ending, though it isn\'t difficult to see the truth coming.For a popcorn flick, the film boasts a great cast. Morgan Freeman is Sloan, the overseer of the Fraternity, and it\'s the first time I\'ve seen him in such a role. He did seem a little awkward with some of the rougher dialogue towards the end of the film (though I guess it\'s to be expected...I never expected to hear Freeman spouting ""Kill THIS motherf***a"" in a film). Angelina Jolie is wonderfully sexy as Fox, though I\'m biased to the point where I\'d love Jolie in just about ANY role. Rounding out the primary cast is James McAvoy as Wesley Gibson; I had not seen any of McAvoy\'s previous work but I loved his work in this movie. He is perfectly suited to play both the meek, anxiety-ridden account manager and the elite killer he becomes. He does a great job inducing the element of dark humor into the film with his great delivery.While I\'ve read quite a few complaints about this film, I can\'t understand why.

This is one KICK A** action flick. My taste in movies is very diverse, and I'am proud to have this in my collection now. If you judge a film based on what it promised to be then this movie is a 10. Anyone that only watched the first 30 mins. and decided they hate it has no room to judge this movie.

Joliet is hotter than ever and reminds me of her days as laura croft.The actor of Wesley Gibson was also very good . He set the tone for the whole movie.The special effects were amazing making this like the matrix but with a whole lot of humor thrown in.All in all that's what makes this ( on my list) the best 2008 summer movie if the year yet!!!"", ""The movie is about a young man who finds out that his long lost father is an assassin who is killed and teams up his organisation to avenge him. Anyway let me get to the point this movie is absolutely horrible!!!! The only way I understood the story is by reading it not on the screenplay of the movie. The first half was so unacceptably bad that I felt like I'm in a car diving with no destination. At the start there was a birthday in an office then all of a sudden there was a useless sex scene. There were so many stupid and composite scenes and the filmmakers expect you to suddenly change your mood which is beyond irritating. The action was daft & unrealistic e.g. bullets that goes where you want them to go and shooting a bullet before it hits.The second half got a bit interesting and was going well but the ending was so bad that it just ruined the second half which was the only good part of the film. Personally I think that the beginning and the ending are the most important scenes of any movie because of the first and last impression and the beginning and the ending were the worst scenes of Wanted. There where also some questions that are left unanswered.Overall I Wanted to see this film when I seen the trailer and it totally turned out to be an Unwanted movie."", ""Definitely a great beer and pizza movie with some lazy friends on a Friday night, but a philosophical masterpiece about work, ennui, and nihilism, I think not.Look, the point is action is action and here the action is just fine. Unlike Crank, or Shoot'em up however it can't find a post modern humor to it, it just plays the action too straight and too improbable, and the word that spring to mind is bathos.However, philosophy is great only if really tight and not pop dollops of pseudo meaning - there is not enough explanation, it's all very mysterious, but simply not mystic enough.I would have liked less bullets and knives and more creativity in the action scenes - and finally at the end of the day the film can't cram in all we need to know in the time continuum provided.Good, if violent, entertainment, but a good film... uh huh.....no way."", 'For the first half hour Wanted felt like a trailer.Adapted from a graphic novel the film never seems to settle,the actors seem ill at ease with the material and the impatience on the directors part leaves us with a messy hackneyed film of action set pieces and sci fi mumbo jumbo inbetween. The film tries far too hard to be cool which is a shame because im sure it could have been a better film if things would have just been done with a little less haste.James McAvoy,so convincing in Last King Of Scotland is hard to like in this role.Morgan Freeman seems totally non interested but to be fair hes given virtually nothing to do and just serves as filler between action scenes.Angelina Jolie is the real star of this film,she has astounding presence as an actress and suits the action genre,its just a shame we cant find a truly memorable action film for her to star in.In summary Wanted is a fast paced but legless action film that promises much but delivers very little.It leaves you wanting.', 'So a friend told me how the book was very different from the movie, and made me read the book... and boy was he right. But more about that later...I recall seeing one of the producers say in an interview that due to all the superhero movies out, they intentionally went for a more ""realistic"" approach. I kept this in mind as I watched this movie. That said, I can only say that it\'s good, not great.James McAvoy, who I\'ve been a fan of since ""Rory O\'Shea Was Here"", does an acceptable job as the movie\'s main character. However, I couldn\'t help but notice his accent seem to be just a little off here and there, which was a little distracting for me. Morgan Freeman and Angelina put in some reliable, albeit unremarkable, roles. And Common, a guy who has more on screen gravitas than most actors, is sadly underused.The action scenes, which are vital for a film like this are very good. There are plenty of ""okay, that was pretty cool"" moments for adrenaline junkies out there. (Fyi: McAvoy actually did the ""on the car hood"" stunt with no CG. Nice job.) The story is good, but considering the original story, it would have been really hard to make a horrible movie. The special effects do a good job of making you believe in the unbelievable and some interesting camera-work and slow-mo also do well to enhance the experience.All in all, above average, but not outstanding. 6 out of 10 BONUS COMMENTARY: The real tragedy about this movie is what it COULD have been. The original comic book wasn\'t about him being an assassin, you see, it was about him training to be a supervillian! That\'s right, in a superhero world, he\'s the Green Goblin, or Lex Luthor, or even the Joker! Now imagine what that movie would have been like! Additionally, they had to train him to be a cold-hearted, homicidal, remorseless bad guy. The book, which is definitely not for kids, is chock full with so much f-you, in-your-face, unapologetic violence this version of the movie would have been looking at an R rating for sure. Anyway, if you get a chance, track down the book and have a read. You can thank me later.', ""Putting it bluntly, 'WANTED' was a rather formulaic and predictable outing. A loserly, office shut-in with the help of a hot babe learns about his past and is suddenly thrust into the world of assassination, a world of flipping cars, extreme gun fights, and mind-altering stunts, thus shedding every bit of his shy, weak self. This we've all seen before.Where 'WANTED' stands apart from any other action film I've seen is in its style. The director has upped the ante on how the action is portrayed. Gone are any sort of boundaries. This is a world where people can flawlessly flip cars over others and land perfectly upright on the other side, where people can shoot from miles away hitting nothing but their target, where people can put such a curve on bullets that they hit multiple targets standing on different planes all with one shot. If people can really do this, perhaps I'm living the same existence as Wesley, and I'm missing out. The film's major selling point is its style and its worth a viewing simply for that.The A-List cast delivers solid performances, but the script they are given - with the exception of the last line uttered in the film - is mostly generic. James McAvoy is sympathetic and relatable as the guy who is overwhelmingly bored with his life but doesn't know how to change it - something many people understand. His transformation into tough guy is effortless and convincing. Angelina Jolie is Fox - a name quite fitting as Jolie looks fantastic; however, we've seen this character on her before. Still, she does it well. Freeman, as usual, injects intelligence into his role, playing the solemn leader of The Fraternity.However, for all the edgy extreme events the film contains, the film is hurt by some pieces that are just plain odd and are never fully explained. For one, The Fraternity gets their targets from a secret code that is woven into tapestries by The Loom of Fate. Sounding like something from a Monty Python sketch, it is never revealed who - if anyone - controls the loom or where it derives its powers. Names are simply revealed through code and the members of The Fraternity don't ask questions. The members of The Fraternity are fully human, but seemingly invincible thanks to some sort of special wax bath devised to heal wounds very quickly. It's the film's easy out that allows them to deliver the goods on all the high-octane action they desire. Lastly, the film turns a very predictable corner that many will see coming from miles away.When the film ends you will realize how simple it is and how ridiculous it is about 75% of the time, but you won't care. The film makes up for every flaw by smearing the screen with mind-bending stunts, unique filmography, and breathtaking visuals - yes, Ms. Jolie is one of them. It will be painfully obvious that all the simple plot details were just the framework and the real substance of the film lies not in its intricate story, but in the execution of its stunts and action. 7/10."", 'I had a lot of expectations for this one. The visuals seemed stunning, the action heart-throbbing and the cast remarkable. And those thing were there but I just couldn\'t shake the feeling of this movie being nothing more than a paycheck.All the memorable dialog, scenes and concepts seemed all TOO familiar. The bullet cam was taken from the video game Max Payne, the keyboard to the face scene from an internet show called PurePwnage, the last line was also taken from a famous Bob Ross parody, the train cart scene was reminiscent of an old children\'s show based on a popular toy, and I could go on...I can look away and call them a coincidence but the last straw was the story. It was preposterously bad! Nothing made any sense, it seemed like they just pulled it out of a hat to house the action. All the characters the protagonist has to fight have no depth to them, this guy can do this, this guy can do that and in the end the hero has to fight the guys that can do this or that. Pathetic...As I exited the theater trying to keep my mind off the senseless favorable criticism that was going on behind me, I heard someone say ""If I was 13 and saw this movie, it would\'ve been the best movie ever"".

Don't try to analyze what you see, while you are in the cinema, just watch and you'll feel yourself inside the constant action.Bekambetov, who has started his shooting career from Russian TV-ads in early 1990-s, loved CGI and camera effects from the very beginning. Now, with a sufficient amount of Hollywood's money he realizes his early dream: CGI in Wanted isn't an addition to the storyline, but the storyline itself."", ""Seriously, what is wrong with all the people who hated this movie?

This is one KICK A** action flick. My taste in movies is very diverse, and I'am proud to have this in my collection now. If you judge a film based on what it promised to be then this movie is a 10. Anyone that only watched the first 30 mins. and decided they hate it has no room to judge this movie.

Anyway let me get to the point this movie is absolutely horrible!!!! The only way I understood the story is by reading it not on the screenplay of the movie. The first half was so unacceptably bad that I felt like I'm in a car diving with no destination. At the start there was a birthday in an office then all of a sudden there was a useless sex scene. There were so many stupid and composite scenes and the filmmakers expect you to suddenly change your mood which is beyond irritating. The action was daft & unrealistic e.g. bullets that goes where you want them to go and shooting a bullet before it hits.The second half got a bit interesting and was going well but the ending was so bad that it just ruined the second half which was the only good part of the film. Personally I think that the beginning and the ending are the most important scenes of any movie because of the first and last impression and the beginning and the ending were the worst scenes of Wanted. There where also some questions that are left unanswered.Overall I Wanted to see this film when I seen the trailer and it totally turned out to be an Unwanted movie."", ""Definitely a great beer and pizza movie with some lazy friends on a Friday night, but a philosophical masterpiece about work, ennui, and nihilism, I think not.Look, the point is action is action and here the action is just fine. Unlike Crank, or Shoot'em up however it can't find a post modern humor to it, it just plays the action too straight and too improbable, and the word that spring to mind is bathos.However, philosophy is great only if really tight and not pop dollops of pseudo meaning - there is not enough explanation, it's all very mysterious, but simply not mystic enough.I would have liked less bullets and knives and more creativity in the action scenes - and finally at the end of the day the film can't cram in all we need to know in the time continuum provided.Good, if violent, entertainment, but a good film... uh huh.....no way."", 'For the first half hour Wanted felt like a trailer.Adapted from a graphic novel the film never seems to settle,the actors seem ill at ease with the material and the impatience on the directors part leaves us with a messy hackneyed film of action set pieces and sci fi mumbo jumbo inbetween. The film tries far too hard to be cool which is a shame because im sure it could have been a better film if things would have just been done with a little less haste.James McAvoy,so convincing in Last King Of Scotland is hard to like in this role.Morgan Freeman seems totally non interested but to be fair hes given virtually nothing to do and just serves as filler between action scenes.Angelina Jolie is the real star of this film,she has astounding presence as an actress and suits the action genre,its just a shame we cant find a truly memorable action film for her to star in.In summary Wanted is a fast paced but legless action film that promises much but delivers very little.It leaves you wanting.', 'So a friend told me how the book was very different from the movie, and made me read the book... and boy was he right. But more about that later...I recall seeing one of the producers say in an interview that due to all the superhero movies out, they intentionally went for a more ""realistic"" approach. I kept this in mind as I watched this movie. That said, I can only say that it\'s good, not great.James McAvoy, who I\'ve been a fan of since ""Rory O\'Shea Was Here"", does an acceptable job as the movie\'s main character. However, I couldn\'t help but notice his accent seem to be just a little off here and there, which was a little distracting for me. Morgan Freeman and Angelina put in some reliable, albeit unremarkable, roles. And Common, a guy who has more on screen gravitas than most actors, is sadly underused.The action scenes, which are vital for a film like this are very good. There are plenty of ""okay, that was pretty cool"" moments for adrenaline junkies out there. (Fyi: McAvoy actually did the ""on the car hood"" stunt with no CG. Nice job.) The story is good, but considering the original story, it would have been really hard to make a horrible movie. The special effects do a good job of making you believe in the unbelievable and some interesting camera-work and slow-mo also do well to enhance the experience.All in all, above average, but not outstanding. 6 out of 10 BONUS COMMENTARY: The real tragedy about this movie is what it COULD have been. The original comic book wasn\'t about him being an assassin, you see, it was about him training to be a supervillian! That\'s right, in a superhero world, he\'s the Green Goblin, or Lex Luthor, or even the Joker! Now imagine what that movie would have been like! Additionally, they had to train him to be a cold-hearted, homicidal, remorseless bad guy. The book, which is definitely not for kids, is chock full with so much f-you, in-your-face, unapologetic violence this version of the movie would have been looking at an R rating for sure. Anyway, if you get a chance, track down the book and have a read. You can thank me later.', ""Putting it bluntly, 'WANTED' was a rather formulaic and predictable outing. A loserly, office shut-in with the help of a hot babe learns about his past and is suddenly thrust into the world of assassination, a world of flipping cars, extreme gun fights, and mind-altering stunts, thus shedding every bit of his shy, weak self. This we've all seen before.Where 'WANTED' stands apart from any other action film I've seen is in its style. The director has upped the ante on how the action is portrayed. Gone are any sort of boundaries. This is a world where people can flawlessly flip cars over others and land perfectly upright on the other side, where people can shoot from miles away hitting nothing but their target, where people can put such a curve on bullets that they hit multiple targets standing on different planes all with one shot. If people can really do this, perhaps I'm living the same existence as Wesley, and I'm missing out. The film's major selling point is its style and its worth a viewing simply for that.The A-List cast delivers solid performances, but the script they are given - with the exception of the last line uttered in the film - is mostly generic. James McAvoy is sympathetic and relatable as the guy who is overwhelmingly bored with his life but doesn't know how to change it - something many people understand. His transformation into tough guy is effortless and convincing. Angelina Jolie is Fox - a name quite fitting as Jolie looks fantastic; however, we've seen this character on her before. Still, she does it well. Freeman, as usual, injects intelligence into his role, playing the solemn leader of The Fraternity.However, for all the edgy extreme events the film contains, the film is hurt by some pieces that are just plain odd and are never fully explained. For one, The Fraternity gets their targets from a secret code that is woven into tapestries by The Loom of Fate. Sounding like something from a Monty Python sketch, it is never revealed who - if anyone - controls the loom or where it derives its powers. Names are simply revealed through code and the members of The Fraternity don't ask questions. The members of The Fraternity are fully human, but seemingly invincible thanks to some sort of special wax bath devised to heal wounds very quickly. It's the film's easy out that allows them to deliver the goods on all the high-octane action they desire. Lastly, the film turns a very predictable corner that many will see coming from miles away.When the film ends you will realize how simple it is and how ridiculous it is about 75% of the time, but you won't care. The film makes up for every flaw by smearing the screen with mind-bending stunts, unique filmography, and breathtaking visuals - yes, Ms. Jolie is one of them. It will be painfully obvious that all the simple plot details were just the framework and the real substance of the film lies not in its intricate story, but in the execution of its stunts and action. 7/10."", 'I had a lot of expectations for this one. The visuals seemed stunning, the action heart-throbbing and the cast remarkable. And those thing were there but I just couldn\'t shake the feeling of this movie being nothing more than a paycheck.All the memorable dialog, scenes and concepts seemed all TOO familiar. The bullet cam was taken from the video game Max Payne, the keyboard to the face scene from an internet show called PurePwnage, the last line was also taken from a famous Bob Ross parody, the train cart scene was reminiscent of an old children\'s show based on a popular toy, and I could go on...I can look away and call them a coincidence but the last straw was the story. It was preposterously bad! Nothing made any sense, it seemed like they just pulled it out of a hat to house the action. All the characters the protagonist has to fight have no depth to them, this guy can do this, this guy can do that and in the end the hero has to fight the guys that can do this or that. Pathetic...As I exited the theater trying to keep my mind off the senseless favorable criticism that was going on behind me, I heard someone say ""If I was 13 and saw this movie, it would\'ve been the best movie ever"". And that\'s what it is, a children\'s movie that tried to captivate the adult mind through pointless sex scenes and drama.', 'I just got back from an advanced screening of Wanted. I have to admit not being a fan of the Director, Tim Bekmambetov. Somewhat disappointed in his Russian Films Nightwatch and Daywatch. However, in his American directorial he delivers!! An abundance of profanities and over the top action sequences that are beyond xtreme fill the screen in a dizzying array of visual adrenaline. Holding you in a tight breathtaking grip with its interesting visual techniques, humor and acting. James McAvoy (the sweet faun from the Chronicles of Narnia) plays the loser we all know, Wesley Gibbon. The guy, who just trudges through life allowing himself to be walked upon, humiliated and has no desire to escape it, except in a bottle of anti-anxiety meds. Enter a beautiful Woman, Fox (Angelie Jolie), a mysterious wise man Sloan (Morgan Freeman) and his life instantly changes from Billing Reports to Gratuitous Violence, Mastering Weaponry Skills, and Assassination. Believe me when I say what the Matrix introduced, Wanted has mastered. The director is a skilled artist at using the camera in conveying visual emotions of Wesley like I have never seen before, wait I take that back, seen it in NightWatch. I definitely recommend this deliberately humorous, action packed, violent, profane, to-the-extreme film to be seen on the big screen - check this one out!!', 'I guess this is my first moment I want to comment on the movie. The reason for that is all those negative comments.People don\'t like the idea of a man making a giant leap across buildings, about the ""plot of the world"" and the ridicule in the movie.But at the same time I guess they DID like Trinity\'s jump in Matrix, destiny (sadame) in any Japanese movie or comedy of Mr and Mrs Smith.COME ON PEOPLE! This is NOT James Bond, Bourne or Die Hard. This is exactly the opposite. This movie in my opinion simply tries to make fun of all those movies. It\'s all a sarcastic view of today\'s action movies. Just like the bullets - bent to the fullest. For me it\'s more of an action comedy. The ideas are so stupid that it\'s funny. Why? Because it was fit in the action movie. I mean come on - the loom, the bullets, the healing stearine, the rats... How can you ever compare it to any action movie that tries to be serious? This is not trying to do that. That\'s why I liked this movie - for its intelligent sarcasm and probably because of all the negative comments from people that expected a ""mature action movie"" and didn\'t understand the movie.', 'I know there is a lot of hate going around for this movie (though it oddly manages to maintain a decent rating despite the nay-saying...) but I would really urge people to watch this movie before letting the opinions of others affect their views on it. Sure, the movie takes some liberties with plot and, obviously, physics, but it makes for a fun action/popcorn movie. It is, after all, just a movie. After seeing this film, I would say it was one of the most fun action films of 2008. It\'s got plenty of violence and stylized action with a dose of sexuality and a decent plot...Wesley Gibson is a miserable account manager with a dead-end life until he is approached by the beautiful Fox, who informs him that his father was a master assassin who had been murdered days before. Gibson is recruited into an assassin\'s guild known as the Fraternity to hunt down and kill his father\'s murderer.The quirk with the Fraternity is that it\'s assassin\'s have the special ability to raise their heart rate above 400 bpm, pumping incredible amounts of adrenaline into their system and giving them superhuman reaction speed...basically ""bullet-time"". So you can expect a lot of over-the-top stunts, including the ability to curve bullet paths. Why there has been a lot of complaints about this aspect of the movie, I don\'t know. It\'s not really over-used and it adds a cool element to the movie. The film has PLENTY of action throughout, though most of my favorite scenes were during the course of Wesley\'s training with the Fraternity. The film also has a ""twist"" ending, though it isn\'t difficult to see the truth coming.For a popcorn flick, the film boasts a great cast. Morgan Freeman is Sloan, the overseer of the Fraternity, and it\'s the first time I\'ve seen him in such a role. He did seem a little awkward with some of the rougher dialogue towards the end of the film (though I guess it\'s to be expected...I never expected to hear Freeman spouting ""Kill THIS motherf***a"" in a film). Angelina Jolie is wonderfully sexy as Fox, though I\'m biased to the point where I\'d love Jolie in just about ANY role. Rounding out the primary cast is James McAvoy as Wesley Gibson; I had not seen any of McAvoy\'s previous work but I loved his work in this movie. He is perfectly suited to play both the meek, anxiety-ridden account manager and the elite killer he becomes. He does a great job inducing the element of dark humor into the film with his great delivery.While I\'ve read quite a few complaints about this film, I can\'t understand why. It\'s a guilty-pleasure action film and it\'s not to meant to be taken completely seriously. It\'s just a MOVIE and a fun one to boot. When you watch this film, just sit back, disengage your brain, and enjoy the non-stop action and fun characters.', ""If you watch this movie with a closed mind you might not care for it.Just take it as it is and it is very good. The special effects are excellent and action is non-stopped. There are plenty of jaw-dropping moments in this movie.Chances are that most of the stunts are highly unlikely, but you're watching a movie, purpose to entertain. It's like watching a superhero movie, no spiders don't make men that shoot webs, or rage that turns someone into a superhuman green giant, but they do entertain. I was very entertained. If you like action, check this movie out and you will not be disappointed."", ""Wanted was by far one of the very best action movies this year. It was a very fun wild ride from start to finish. It had many twists, turns, gore, blood, and action. Just strap in and get ready for one hell of a roller coaster ride. It kind of got confusing at some parts in the movie so you have to pay attention very close. You would be surprised how many funny parts and jokes they had in this movie. I was also stunned by all the twists and turns the movie took toward the end. By the end of this movie it will leave you shocked. The acting could not have been any better. Angelina Jolie did an amazing job playing an assassin. James McEvoy was funny but also at the same time very serious when it came down to killing people. Morgan Freeman was very good as usual and brought a lot to this film. The stunts in this movie have no words to describe how good they were. The gun techniques were outstanding. Some of the things they do with the gun though is very fake and far-fetched. I think that the movie was even better because of it getting an R rating. This movie definitely deserved one and you will notice during the movie. If it didn't get the R rating it wouldn't have been a s good as it was. Overall this movie is a must see movie. It is worth every penny to go see it. The one must see movie of the year is WANTED."", 'As action movies go, they don\'t get much better then this.The action scenes were amazing... I was sitting on the edge of my seat on more than one sequence. Of course some of it\'s a bit far fetched but come on... Aren\'t MOST action movies? James MacAvoy did an amazing job playing the average joe who is suddenly told he has the ability in him to be a ""wolf among the sheep"" I enjoyed his American accent. Angelina was great. She does very well in roles like this and even though she doesn\'t have too many lines she pulls off her character who TRULY believes in what she does very well. Plus, she\'s hot. I mean, I\'m a woman who doesn\'t particularly even like tattoos and I have a crush on her.. ;-) In all I highly recommend this movie. Great summer entertainment!', ""I had the chance to see an advanced screening of this movie. If it was out already, I would have went and seen it again. Wanted has pushed the limits of what an action movie should be. (just as the Matrix did) They could not have picked better actors to be in this movie. James McAvoy (Wesley) brings a dorky, dark humor to the movie, Angelina Jolie brings a cocky, bad ass tone, and Morgan Freeman, well, what movie isn't he perfect in. Everything from the plot, action scenes, special effects, and overall acting, all perfect. From beginning to end, Wanted is flawless! I won't give away anything, just be sure that you go see this movie, it's totally worth it!"", '(Synopsis) Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a neurotic accounts manager who works in a small cubical filling out billing reports day end and day out. He allows his boss and his girlfriend to walk all over him. To cope with his life, he takes anti-anxiety pills by the bottle full. Wesley has no desire to change his humdrum life, but one day while getting more pills at the drug store, he meets a beautiful woman in black, Fox (Angelina Jolie) who changes his life forever. Fox was sent to protect Wesley from the man who had just killed his father. Wesley thought his father had died soon after he was born. Fox tells Wesley, ""that your father died yesterday on the rooftop of the Metropolitan Building and you are next"". Wesley is recruited into the ""Fraternity,"" a secret society of assassins that his father was a member. Fox must train Wesley to bring out his special powers that he was born with in order to avenge his father\'s death.(My Comment) This is one of those movies that cubical workers can relate to. The audience can imagine that they don\'t have to take it anymore, especially, if you have special powers. Wesley changes from this meek nobody going through life just putting in his time into a person with confidence and strength and the ability to change his own destiny. James McAvoy did an outstanding job in playing the roll of Wesley. Angelina Jolie didn\'t have many lines in the movie, but her presence was more for having an intimidating and dangerous killer with good looks. The visual effects of slowing down the speed of curving bullets and bullets crashing into each other are very well done. The movie is entertaining with lots of action and moves at a fast pace. By the end, you see that Wesley has truly become his own man. (Universal Pictures, Run Time 1:50, Rated R)(10/10)', 'I went to a screening of Wanted last night in Toronto. It was more than I hoped for. James McAvoy was the perfect leading man. At the beginning you felt for him being such a loser and then you grow with him through the movie.Angelina Jolie did not have a large part in the movie, she was there but there was not much focus on her. Which suited me just fine.The only gripe I can have with this movie is that near the end there were bits that seemed predictable, not the whole thing ...but little parts here or there.Timur Bekmambetov did an amazing job directing this, and I am looking forward to more product from him in the future.', ""It's really hard to shoot films based on the cartoons and not to repeat some common features.

Americans... They don\'t know Geography, they think that The Eiffel Tower is in USA and Bulgaria is a country in Africa... OK. In rest, except some good old songs in the soundtrack, the film is boring, only static dialogue from start to finish. The only good thing(for them too) is that Samuel L. Jackson and Morgan Freeman (always presents in any film in recent years...), are not in this film!', ""Miles Teller and Jonah Hill in a movie about international gun runners? Sign me up! Is what I was saying going into the film. Coming out was a different story. As is the story with many movies so far this year, 'War Dogs' is a boring mess of a movie. If you saw 'The infiltrator' or read my review you know I hated that film. And for the same reasons I hate that film, I hate this one. Except this one has the nerve to be nearly identical to the far superior 'Wolf Of Wall Street'. This movie hits all the same beats and story lines that Scorseses near masterpiece does. The difference between the two is that this one is neither funny nor entertaining to watch. It is quite possibly one of the most dull, lifeless, boring films I have seen this year. Every time something funny or stressful could have happened it just cuts to another scene. Or, even more upsetting, ques up a voice over track from Teller. It blatantly skips over possible character building scenes in favor of out of place, lazy voice overs.I don't think I would be lying when I say that there is more voice overs here than in 'Knight of Cups'. Which literally had not script. Why the choice was made to do this really comes down to laziness. There is no other reason to explain why it couldn't just let scenes play out. Not only was there countless voice overs that robbed scenes of tension, but it also did chapter kind of things.Every twenty minutes or so a black screen with a sentence appeared on screen, describing what we were about to see. Just like the voice work, it didn't seem to have a point to it. It just felt like it didn't know how to transfer to the next scene so it threw in these random titles. They came from no where and served literally no purpose other than to tell you what was going to happen before it did.But what was I expecting? Right from the first few scenes this film has jarring tones that clash with each other from scene to scene. The first shot of the movie is a tense scene involving a kidnapping and it cuts immediately to a stylized, scene with a pop song playing over top. It is a completely jarring tonal shift that is off and on through out the film. And, much like 'Suicide Squad' it has no idea how to place a song in a scene.The songs it chooses are good on their own but, the scenes they are used in makes me hate them. All but maybe once were they used appropriately. It's sad that films have decided to just throw in pop songs to try and get a bigger audience instead of making a score that works in the film. It never helps the story move forward, they are all just kind of there.That being said, nothing could have saved this story. As I said, it's exactly like 'Wolf of Wall Street'. But it's not near as fun nor does it have the interesting character study that 'Wall Street' has. It has Jonah Hill and Miles Teller furiously trying to make the dialogue they have sound organic. Yet, it's so poorly written that these Oscar worthy actors come across with little chemistry and sound like morons while doing it.There isn't much that redeems this film. It's mostly well shot and these two performances aren't to bad. Other than that everything fails. It's poorly written, horribly boring, offers no interesting characters, and fails to deliver any comedic moments. It's one of those movies that thinks it's so much better than it is. It wants to be great and desperately tries to be but falls flat on its face."", ""In 'War Dogs' we follow Miles Teller and Jonah Hill as two young men trying to make money from the war in Iraq by selling weapons to the US army. The movie is directed by Todd Phillips who is better known for the 'The Hangover' trilogy.Right of the bat the movie tries to seem more clever than it actually is. Via a flash-forward that shows one of the main characters in a predicament the movie tries to create a sense of tension that would otherwise have been non-apparent. This quickly fades as the story is very predictable with characters that are not all that interesting considering their motives are never properly explained and very flimsy. Throughout the movie is some narration paired with title cards indicating different chapters. Most of the times the chapters do not seem any different which made these title cards unnecessary and it is clear they were just added afterwards in as a last ditch effort to make the movie more interesting. Halfway trough the movie almost comes to a grinding halt and from thereon out it never really manages to get the viewer's interest back.The directing was very bland, considering not one scene was shot in a very interesting fashion. Often times it seemed as if the movie does not really know what it wants to be. Sometimes character's respond to a certain situation in a comedic fashion while other times the tone is shifted to a more serious one. Todd Phillips never really tries to mix in some of his own style and with another director the movie would've probably turned out roughly the same. The only redeeming factor of the movie are the actors themselves as they did a decent job at portraying their characters, though ultimately not one performance was very memorable. In the end 'War Dogs' joins the 2016 collection of disappointing summer movies.My rating: 4/10"", '\'War dogs\' is one of the most anticipated movies of this summer. When I saw the trailer it felt to me that there is so much fun and it will be a good entertainer movie. Casting is also good. Jonah Hill is a good actor but is a very good comedian and Miles teller is a promising actor. It is a ""based on true story"" film so My expectation was huge and as a comedy movie it is good and the story pick up is fair. The title of the film tells you nothing but maybe this is a metaphor.I am not telling this is only a comedy and fun film. The story is very serious and there are good crude and real incident humor are in this movie. So if anyone is searching the seriousness of that issue it will be good. This is the story of two young men, David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli. They won a contract of 300 million from the Pentagon to arm America\'s allies in Afghanistan. It is a very funny story and the script makes this more interesting. There are lots of real incidents with good political humor and good double meaning dialogues. These double meaning dialogues will make you laugh and the political drama will make you thinking the real reason of the arms dealing. Jonah Hill and Miles Teller has done a very good job and the background score is a perfect matching. The story is good and fresh with good humor. the direction could have been better but not bad. The only negative point is movie\'s pace. Very slow pace movie and sometimes I felt the continuity is not built well. The story-telling style is also another negative point. It could have been better. Otherwise, it is a good movie. The story writer could have made this more believable but after all I will say it is a good choice for fun lover.', 'War DogsOne could sum up this movie in a single word, ""formulaic.""If you\'ve ever watched any of the movies about West Coast drug-dealing of the 80s (Blow), or any movie with Benicio Del Toro in it (Snatch, Traffic), you will quickly recognize one or more of the stylistic techniques stamped all over this movie:Off-camera narration by one of the protagonists talking about how smart or stupid they were at this point in the adventure.Wackiness in the face of danger. Celebration of the stoner mentality.Overhead shots using helicopters or drones.Overuse of circular camera dolly around two subjects quibbling to suggest ""tension.""Cool music.Oddity------Choice of music. The setting for the movie is the early 2000s, and these guys are in their 20s, yet the music is a collection golden oldies from 60s. Is that the music the producers like? Is it aimed at the suspected target audience?Nitpicks-------The lead character says ""Bro"" more times than any character in any movie in history. Guess that\'s a refreshing change from ""dude."" LOL.Aside from all that, I still liked the movie, just thought is was hackneyed and formulaic.', 'I don\'t know enough about the original story to determine the accuracy of Todd Phillips\'s ""War Dogs"", but it\'s an enjoyable movie. The tricks pulled by David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli just go to show that the people in the business of weapons have no principles (even violating arms embargoes). They\'re out to make money by any means necessary. To be certain, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq proved quite profitable for weapons manufacturers. The mistake that Packouz and Diveroli made was getting caught.It\'s not a masterpiece, but it does a respectable job showing the degrees to which these types go to enrich themselves. A very slimy world indeed.', ""There were many shocking and quite unbelievable stories to emerge from the U.S. during the Bush/Cheney administration, but none were quite as fantastical as the overwhelming position 20-something minor-league arms dealers Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz found themselves in. Their tale is utterly preposterous, but entirely true, although events naturally have been dramatised for the film. Like something straight out of a culture-clash comedy from the 1980s, Diveroli and Packouz landed a $298 million Pentagon contract involving over a hundred million rounds of ammunition. The mishandling of the deal and the pair's subsequent falling out was covered in a Rolling Stone article by Guy Lawson, and later in a book by Lawson entitled Arms and the Dudes.David Packouz (Miles Teller) is a pot-smoking massage therapist working in Miami, Florida, dividing his spare time between his girlfriend Iz (Ana de Armas) and trying, somewhat unsuccessfully, to flog the high-quality Egyptian bed-sheets that he has invested in to retirement homes. At a funeral, he encounters his old best friend Efraim (Jonah Hill), who has made a success in Los Angeles trading in arms on eBay. They rekindle their friendship, despite Efraim proving himself to be a unpredictable loose-cannon, and David eventually joins his chum at his new business venture AEY. With the war raging in Iraq, the government has set up a website offering contracts for weapons and military equipment. David's job is to pick up the crumbs; those small orders the big companies ignore.There are, as Efraim informs David, a hell of a lot of crumbs, and the two are soon making their fortunes while Efraim indulges in everything from prostitutes to copious amounts of cocaine. The two grew up loving Brian De Palma's Scarface (1983), and imagery from the film adorns AEY's office walls. The same unquenchable greed that possessed Al Pacino's character seems to drive Efraim also, and it isn't long before you can see the inevitable downfall on the horizon. Director Todd Phillips, on the back of those terrible The Hangover sequels, seems to be intent on making a semi-serious film, and wisely takes inspiration from some of America's great dark-side- of-the-American-dream cinematic works, such as De Palma's aforementioned drug-lord saga and Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990). But, unlike Adam McKay's The Big Short from last year, Phillips doesn't have the nerve to go all the way.Where McKay exquisitely balanced comedy, drama and satire to dazzling effect, Phillips seems too intent on focusing on the goofball antics of its hapless anti-heroes to deliver any real bite. This is a story that highlights many things from the government's irresponsible approach to warfare, the dangerous practice of allowing just anybody to legally deal in arms, and the devastating effects of blind ambition, but these themes are only touched upon. Packouz is essentially our lead character, but he feels like little more than an exposition tool, with de Armas getting the thankless role of the boring partner who must warn her hubby whenever his actions lead him into the dark side. Thankfully, Jonah Hill is a tour de force, cranking his loathsome character up to 11 without ever feeling unbelievable, proving once again what a versatile actor he is becoming. If you're looking for an intelligent satire of a fascinating recent event, then you probably won't find it here, but as a piece of entertainment, it certainly delivers."", ""If you surf the web regularly, then you sooner or later encounter annoying ads promising to reveal to you some sort of secret or 'loophole' that will make you rich. While they are overwhelmingly ignored, the persistence of these ads proves that they gather at least some clicks, if only from people who are bored.Recently, Hollywood appears to have evolved the 'loophole' idea into a little movie genre of its own (seen in 'limitless', 'the big short', 'wolf of wallstreet'). The protagonist, an ordinary Joe with whom we are supposed to identify, comes across a loophole which allows them to generate very large amounts of money using immoral and/or illegal means. To avoid real controversy, the discussion of what is wrong with the system that allows this to happen regularly is usually very limited and there is a catharsis in the end: the protagonist is caught, but gets to go back to an 'ordinary' life. The fast food version of social criticism if you will.If the kind of movie I just described is familiar to you, then there is nothing in 'War Dogs' that you will find unexpected. The acting is fair but not memorable - and so is everything else about this movie. The plot does not offer any real twists, down to the fact that (here slight SPOILER) the 'catharsis' part is triggered when the guy who is introduced in the first part of the movie as somebody who cheats people does just that with our protagonist. I can't say that I hated 'War Dogs', but this is only because I did not really care much about it."", ""War Dogs seems like a film with a ton of potential, because of the people involved in it, but lacks the spark to make it anything other than okay. The problem seems to be that the crew wanted to tell a true story and make the audience laugh but didn't fully understand, given the source material, how to do that. War Dogs is intermittently funny, but relies too much on clichés, and fails to pack any kind of a punch. If you're trying to figure out what kind of a movie this is, picture The Big Short with a slightly lesser known crew.War Dogs did have a lot going for it, namely the talents of Miles Teller and Jonah Hill, as well as the direction of Todd Phillips (The Hangover Trilogy.) Above that the trailers for this film looked fairly funny, but note that almost all of the genuinely funny parts of the movie are contained in the trailer. That being said the film often tries to take a more dramatic approach, and fails to ever generate a hilarious moment. That being said both Miles Teller and Jonah Hill's performances are great in this film.While Teller and Hill are great in this film it really feels too familiar, as if you've seen it before. That shouldn't be the case with a film about two men in their twenties running guns in the Iraq War. That being said it ends up making it's characters into clichés, and tells an overdone storyline about rags to riches idiots, and betrayal of best friends. It really is a shame because, as I mentioned before, this film could've been very original and interesting, but ends up being like most other films of today, more recycled than anything else.Above that the film fails, at what it ultimately wants to do, which is pack a punch. It seems self evident watching it, that the director and writers wanted to expose a scary problem in America, and at the same time generate a few laughs. In that sense it's a lot like The Big Short, however War Dogs fails to ever do what it strives to do. Where The Big Short was informational, funny, and in the end terrifyingly honest, War Dogs is not. This movie may have a moment or two, but seems to miss it's intended mark on both ends, in that it's not as funny as it'd like to be nor is it as damning. In the end War Dogs feels like more of an average film, which is disappointing because it had the potential to do everything wanted to. If you expect a great comedy, it's not really that, if you're expecting a great look at true and terrifying events that led to two young immature men running guns for America, it's not really that either. War Dogs is funny, well acted, and has a story to tell, but relies on clichés, stereotypes, and doesn't offer very much thought provoking material. This is a good film if you want a few chuckles but it doesn't supply a ton of laughs."", ""Similar tone to Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, It was a lot more serious than what I expected after seeing the trailer. It's not the first time I've seen either Miles Teller or Jonah Hill in something more dramatic, I just may have assumed their first real outing together in a movie would be more of a straight up comedy.Semi based on a true story of two young guys from Miami who became arms dealers, Miles Teller narrates the story of how David Packouz teamed up with this best friend from the tenth grade, Efraim Diveroli and got in too over his head.I was expecting more comedy from the two rather than just two young stars being entertaining. The movie is not disappointing with the team of Teller and Hill. If you are a fan of either one of these guys you are going to love the film.Jonah Hill gives a performance that seem to be something between what he did in 21 Jump Street and the Wolf of Wall Street. The part just fits him so well as he plays a con man who tries to be everyone to everything on the outside but is really evil in the inside, and no matter how much you discover about his evil, Hill still makes the character likable.But the likability is more met for Miles Teller, who Hill is supporting with greatness. Teller plays the sympathetic role of a man whose lost in his life at a time when his girl is about to have a baby, and he needs the money.Director, Todd Phillips weaves a story about how people have profited from the war, and done bad things to profit from a bad war. It's almost like the Big Short, with it's explanation about how the arms game really works, but I always felt that the actual story was getting overshadow by the personalities of the two stars worthy of watching.But overall, It is a very funny film and very entertaining, thanks to the Hill, Teller combohttp://cinemagardens.com"", 'Right off the bat the best part of this movie is the acting: Teller and Hill have great chemistry on screen. Jonah does a particularly good job at playing the ""guy you love to hate"". I can\'t attest to the faithfulness of their portrayal of the real life people since I don\'t know anything about them. The rest of the cast does a great job as well.The marketing for this movie was, unfortunately, deceitful: the trailer made it out to be this upbeat, funny, over the top comedy - which it\'s not. In reality the movie has a much slower pace, not a lot of situational humor and is certainly not filled with hilarious quips (the bulk of which are in the trailer). This is not to say that the movie was bad or not at all funny, it just wasn\'t what I expected (and I am sure I\'m not alone).My final critique will go unnoticed for the majority of viewers but I found it personally offensive so I have to report it: some of the movie takes place in Albania, only the set for Albania is actually Romania. Which is fine, I understand that they probably did this for practical reasons and as a Romanian movie goer I just have to accept it (we all recognized it immediately though). However, at some point in the movie an ""Albanian"" woman says something, only she says it in Romanian. This may not seem like much but it totally took me out of the movie and ruined the experience for me. I find it completely unacceptable that they could not hire an Albanian to say those few lines. The two languages might seem interchangeable to the rest of the world, I am sure, but that was very much NOT the case for me and everyone else in the theater.I am a paying movie goer as well and I expect to be just as entertained as everyone else. This is, of course, not the first time that I\'ve seen this in a film. But when a producer does something like this it shows me that they don\'t respect their movie, so they can\'t expect me to.My rating, however, is not based on this final bit of criticism. I gave it a 7/10 for slow pacing and lack of humor, which is the opposite of what I expected.I\'d still recommend it, just don\'t expect to be blown away.After watching it for a second time I decided to change my original rating from 7/10 to 8/10, mainly because the acting is just great and I respect the fact that the movie made me think about it and made me want to see it again.', ""If you like wolf of wall street, I believe you are gonna like this movie too, even though it not have all the funny moments. The plot is similar a nice guy (Teller) find a way to make money doing stuff located on the line of legal and illegal. The music was well chosen for every scene, acting (specially from Hill and Cooper) was outstanding. On the contrary if you though that Wolf.. didn't show enough all the people who suffer from their actions, and that the movie glorifies bad actions and the eternal search for money, you will not like this movie. It all depends in the end of your personal standards of what can be made fun of, and what subjects are too controversial (in this case, war, guns and arms dealers) to have a good time with."", 'War Dogs is based on a true story where two twenty somethings sell arms back to the US government. Jonah Hill and Mills Teller put up a great performance, they made the story very appealing. The storyline had plenty of connections with Scarface, from locations to tag lines. It was a good movie with a great cast. Definitely worth watching.', ""This film is definitely worth the watch. Jonah Hill and Myles Teller both shine superbly in this film, and Bradley Cooper has some genuine mystique about him during his performance. However, this is the second film I have seen this year, that seems to try and recapture the brilliance of Martin Scorcese's 'Wolf of wall street'. What I mean by that is both this film and 'The Big Short' take a complex real life event, that not a whole lot of people fully understood, and made a film that took time to make light of the scenarios, and tried to explain them to the audience in a common way. This film does it well, and beats 'The Big Short' as it was definitely the easier film to follow. However, it does use a lot of comedy aspects from 'Wold of Wall Street'. You compare Jonah Hill's character Efraim to Donnie his character from TWOWS, they are exactly the same for the first half of this movie. Also, this movie makes light of a very serious real life scenario, and felt to safe considering the context. It's to light hearted and the only real drama or tension comes from the two friends. On it's own this film is highly re-watchable, and that's down to the lightheartedness, but take a second to stop and think about the real life story, it feels to lighthearted. With Wall Street it worked because all the characters were terrible people, so it was funny to see them mess up. Here, Myles Teller plays a very likable character, and with some of the sinister characters, this film needed to feel more threatening. However, credit is where credits due, the film did a great job of breaking down how arms dealing works, the same way TWOWS did for stock brokering. and the tone just felt fun, and made it easy to watch. To use wrestling terms, the heel turn seemed a little off, and needed more build, and also just the amount of similarities to TWOWS, from the way they close it out, to Jonah Hill's performance, just the narration by Teller, these films are almost parallel, so that holds this film back from being truly great. But, the funny thing is, this film works. Hill's performance as both a comedic and dramatic actor is fantastic, he balances the two so well. If you haven't seen TWOWS, your going to love this move a hell of a lot, while the film lacks the risks to make it an instant classic, and is to lighthearted on the seriousness of this real life industry, its still fun and re-watchable, and the script and how this film flows just makes it enjoyable viewing. I know I have talked long about the lack of originality, but honestly besides that and the lack of tone, or pushing the boundaries, the film does its job well. Hill and Teller have great chemistry, and I could go back and watch this over and over again. The effort to make people aware of this event can not be faulted, and they made arms dealing and the art of war a lot easier to understand that Big Short did for the financial crisis in 08. The sinister tone to end it, was definitely a tonal shift, but I won't spoil it for you here. I'm just going to say, you will have fun, if you're a fan of TWOWS or similar films, or you really enjoy Jonah Hill or Myles Teller, they deliver. I'm giving it a 4/5 stars. If it pushed the boundaries more, and had more originality I would have given it a 4.5 which I only reserve for great movies. As it is though, it's a re-watchable, fun, well acted, educational film. And you won't even know you're being educated."", ""Hangover/Due Date director Todd Philipps makes a film base on the true story of young, entrepreneur gun-runners David Parkouz and Efraim Diveroli who managed to secure a ridiculous contract to supply arms to the afghan army via the pentagon. Miles Teller plays the struggling and ambitious David who bumps into his childhood buddy Efraim played by Jonah Hill who is somewhat of the opposite, a loose cannon, fearless and a little trigger-happy. Now, Efraim has found himself a little niche in the market, the market of arms dealing and strikes up small deals with the US military. David needs a job to support his expecting girlfriend, the stunning Ana de Armas who looks a little like Penelope Cruz only more beautiful and has one of those exotic accents. Efraim sees an opportunity for David and the two team up to what leads to the deal of the century for all parties involved. Now, the film has plenty of other film references most notably Scarface, even one of the promotional posters is a respectful nod to the DePalma/Pacino's film. But it's actually Lord of War Efraim is a huge fan of in real-life and it's probably more like Lord of War than Scarface, yet it has tinge of Pain & Gain, another crazy true story movie. Maybe it's Miami? But it has that vibrant and funny yet serious storytelling style that makes the film almost unbelievable and shocking. The rest of the cast does include Bradley Cooper who also produced the film, playing the harden, borderline war-criminal, pretty much the Branson of the arms market and someone you don't really want to be messing with. There's Kevin Pollack playing the bankroll and an awesome cameo of venture capitalist playboy millionaire Dan Bilzerian. It's accompanied by a great soundtrack with tracks from 50cent, Beastie Boys, Iggy Pop, UB40 and CCR but the awesome score threw me completely thinking it was Harry Gregson-Williams or Steve Jablonski, no, it was Cliff Martinez with those ambient sounds. The film is highly entertaining, funny in parts but this is not a comedy; its perfectly paced with some great scenes like the duo gun-running across the triangle of death and some nice camera work. However it's not to epic portions, not that it should put anyone off watching this, it's still a very watchable and enjoyable film and I don't think they could have done it any better.

It deserves to do better than it has so far."", ""Most people are going to want to see this film based on the trailer alone. It looks like a funny and adventurous heist movie of some sort. While it's not a comedy in the truest sense, it's just light enough to keep the audience involved.The film follows two twenty-somethings, Miles Teller and Jonah Hill, as they venture to the top of the international arms dealer industry. Amidst the war in Iraq, they use unorthodox techniques to fulfill US military contracts.War Dogs gets a little wordy when it's setting things up. Also, Teller's voice-over goes on a little bit too long at times. But while verbose when explaining things, it covers a lot of ground answering most of our questions in a Big Short type of way. Thus, a potentially byzantine premise never becomes convoluted.Teller plays David Packouz, the antiwar protagonist who is contributing to the war effort out of financial necessity. He's good, but Hill arguably carries the film, playing the real-life Efraim Diveroli. He's basically a selfish scumbag who could double as a mob boss at any given moment. Hill broadens his range as an actor with this role, proving he can play sinister along with his goofy trademark. He's so deceptively creepy that we become literally afraid of him.Genre-wise, it might seem to be stuck in limbo, but it's not. The comedy is evenly written and is balanced consistently into the drama. The exposition is fast-paced and doesn't require us to look back scratching our heads.War Dogs doesn't necessarily explore any new territory as far as the life of a criminal goes, but it's educational and entertaining every step of the way.Twizard Rating: 89"", 'Holy crap.That is my summary of War Dogs. The movie was produced by Todd Phillips–director of the Hangover movies–and Bradley Cooper. The truly crazy part, though, is that War Dogs is real-life. It\'s a story based on actual events, but if you didn\'t know that it wouldn\'t seem much different than one of the Hangover movies.The movie focuses on a two twenty-something friends in Miami Beach who become international arms dealers. Their company–AEY–leveraged a federal website to find and land lucrative contracts with the Pentagon. Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill) and David Packouz (Miles Teller) eventually landed a $300 million contract to arm the Afghan military, but government corruption and some illegal decisions on their part proved to be their undoing.All of this went down only a few short years ago. Diveroli and Packouz–as AEY– were able to take advantage of an initiative implemented by the Bush administration to expand federal contract opportunities to small businesses. In 2011, however, the two were convicted of multiple counts of fraud. Diveroli was sentenced to four years in federal prison, while Packouz was sentenced to seven months\' house arrest.If you want all of the salacious details, read the lengthy feature article in Rolling Stone written by Guy Lawson. It was this article that first caught Todd Phillips attention and led to the War Dogs movie project.In a Q&A following the screening I saw, Phillips and Cooper shared some of the back story and their experiences making the movie. Phillips said the project was built around the idea of Jonah Hill starring in from the beginning. In fact, Phillips said that he had actually been trying to work with Hill for years–revealing that he originally tried to get Hill to be in The Hangover as the younger brother. The role was eventually re-imagined as an older brother and given to Zach Galifianakis instead.It seems like a brilliant choice. I don\'t know how Efraim Diveroli acts in real life, but Hill seems like a natural in the role. Miles Teller also does an excellent job as Packouz–the character through whose eyes the movie is told.If you\'ve seen the Hangover movies, you know how that group of friends manages to get into a lot of trouble resulting from a series of comical errors and bad decisions. That\'s pure fiction, though. Phillips relayed the story of how he first learned about and became interested in this story. ""I remember, I was literally flying to Bangkok–we were shooting Hangover 2–and I read it in Rolling Stone just like anybody. I just couldn\'t–the thing that attracted me is I couldn\'t believe it was real, honestly. It just felt like it was one of those, um–you know, if it was a piece of fiction in The New Yorker I would have said, \'Oh. That\'s a cool story. Cool characters. But, it\'s so unbelievable it kind of doesn\'t work.\'"" The Q&A moderator asked, ""Bradley, when you found out about the story, was there anything that really surprised you? Where you were just like, \'This couldn\'t be true\'?"" Cooper replied, ""Oh my\xa0God. Where do we start?"" Granted, this is a movie that is ""based on a true story"", which means that there is some artistic license and embellishment for the sake of entertainment. Phillips stressed that this is not a documentary, but also shared that Lawson–who is more familiar with the story than just about anybody other than Efraim and David themselves–expressed that he was pleasantly surprised with the journalistic integrity of the film.War Dogs is an excellent movie. The acting is exceptional and the story is engaging. It is 114 minutes of entertainment that will be worth every penny you pay to see it. The fact that it is somehow a true story of two anonymous young men doing something extraordinary is just icing on the cake.']",21,"['Comedy', 'Crime', 'Drama']"

Original in a bad way people but because the people of today are very much simple minded and perhaps there are many women rating this or something is beyond my understanding. Movies that really deserve a 7 or higher get rated 4's and 5's but this one has changed my mind on folk who do rate low. Production value is not bad, acting not bad, Ponies not bad, lol and idea wasn't bad but this movie had a strong way of annoyance with the humans and zombies working together due to a couple comprising of a boy zombie and a girl. Talking Zombies is not bad but those that feel... can love... can become human again is not something that should have ever been done. Kissing the dead... BIG NO! What perverted person could ever get away with away with that? Let it been a woman zombie kissing a man and this be on the cover of Newsweekly for a sham. This is a movie for a group of illiterate high school minded folk who get kicks of this mess. Pure calamity of the horror genre. Waste of my time after watching another waste of my time watching Jack the Giant Slayer. Hollywood could only be the one to get away of Zombies becoming Human. Disaster from the beginning to the end."", ""When I first saw the trailer for Warm Bodies I didn't know what to take out of it. Are they trying to be this year's Zombieland? Is it going to have any horror in it at all, or will it be more of a romantic comedy? Will it have an indie feel, or would it have too much CGI? Then I saw that Jonathan Levine (The Wackness, 50/50) was directing it, and I suddenly was on board for this movie.Heading into this movie, I was hoping that this could be another gem hidden in the trash-movie-month that is January. I got The Grey last January, so could I get another one this year? Eh, no.This film certainly has its moments where it's pretty entertaining, but unfortunately there are too many other missed opportunities that overshadow the bright spots. Probably the best part about this movie was that it gave an honest try at an original idea, which is obviously more than we can say about the majority of movies.Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer were the two main actors in the film. There were moments where they probably could have used an extra take or two. Overall, they did their jobs well enough. John Malkovich plays the recognizable face that doesn't really need to be in the movie, but it's more marketable if he is character of Teresa Palmer's strict father.The main issue that I had with the film was that there were so many conveniences. There were too many scenes in the film that were just glanced over quickly, but most of the audience would assume would be a large emotional plot point. There were far too many moments that felt like they were rushed to be able to finish the story faster, which is odd considering the film is just over 90 minutes.I walked out of the theater feeling underwhelmed. I can't say that I dislike the film by any means, but I can't say I'll ever watch it again. It was a fine way to spend an hour and a half. I had some laughs, and I liked certain aspects of the movie. It will definitely entertain some, and it will definitely bother some. Unfortunately, the fact is that there were too many overly convenient parts of the movie for me.5/10"", 'Warm Bodies is Summit Entertainment\'s latest foray to capture the ""Twi- hard"" audience by delivering a new spin on zombies.

The underlining tone of Romeo and Juliet is obvious. The laughs are not as often as one would hope. The suspense is less than suspenseful.

Even if one could believe that a zombie could come back to life - the zombie should not lose all of it's scars that it earned along the way during the transformation. The chemistry would have been amazing but for the most part, Julie is scared to death of R, as she should be, so her sudden feelings for him are not believable. Overall, a cute film. One worth watching - once."", 'I\'ve read the book and like most adaptations, it would be easy to say the book was better. This one is not the exception, unfortunately. But let\'s focus on the movie.What ruined this movie is the simple fact that they spoiled the entire story in the trailers and marketing. ""Their love is the cure"". Seriously? Am I supposed to hope they DON\'T fall in love? They could have based the trailers and marketing on the fact that ""R"" (Nicholas Hoult) is a self-aware, thinking and undead zombie and it would be enough to make me wonder what a zombie\'s life is about. They thought knowing the climax from the start wasn\'t a problem apparently.For those who like to compare this to the Twilight franchise, personally I wouldn\'t. It\'s not meant to be neither epic or a ""saga"". Yes, it\'s a surreal teenager love story but they clearly don\'t have the same approach. If you look for Twi-like movies, watch the trailers before Warm Bodies and you\'ll find plenty.This movie is still somewhat fun with some funny lines and expressions but quite inconsistent. The characters felt dry and shallow. The drama bits were barely affecting the characters or the story. The action is basic and mostly made of CGI. The story felt simply felt rushed and there was no tension to keep me entertained.Maybe this flick will appeal to younger people and those who haven\'t read the book but as a movie on it\'s own, I can\'t give it more than a 6/10. It\'s an ""ok"" movie.', 'Finally the great zombie romance? Well, maybe not, but it\'s the closest I\'ve seen. You get to see zombie life from the perspective of a zombie, who starts to get feelings for a girl who\'s alive. Through a set of circumstances, he ""rescues"" her and they take refuge in a grounded plane at an airport overrun by the undead. There were several original elements that I had never seen in a zombie movie. First and foremost is the narration by our young zombie giving us insights into his condition. He can barely utter words, but weirdly, in his head, he seems smart and talks normally. I liked that part and I was kinda sorry when he got somewhat better at talking, therefore evacuating most of his thoughts. Second original element was the romance. I wasn\'t impressed by it, but at least it was slow-building, somewhat charming, avoiding most of the disgusting stuff, and you kind of rooted for them by the end.Third original element would be the zombies not stuck as they are. They can ""evolve"" (our hero) or ""devolve"" (bonies, zombies who shed their outer skins, looking almost like black ghouls or skeletons). Speaking of bonies, I thought they looked amazing, creepy even, but their movements were stiff and made them look computer-generated. Also, who knew that eating brains for zombies could be a way for them to live vicariously the past life of the person they ate, through visions. It\'s not even the only way they can ""change"", although the other way, though nice, seemed a bit far-fetched and too quick. Fourth original element was that there was sometimes a humanistic, hopeful even, vibe to the proceedings despite the dramatic elements. There\'s something at the end involving the zombies and the bonies that I had never seen before. So the movie is more original than one might think, however the execution wasn\'t flawless.Sure, overall, I found the movie had charms, but for me the laughs were few and far between, like most romantic comedies I suppose. Because it\'s supposed to be one of those, but with obviously more somber elements. The drama could have used more ""teeth"" to make this film truly memorable and moving though. The movie even made me think of Romeo & Juliet as well as Edward Scissorhands, not bad stories to be associated with. The creators never really went into total parody or silly mode, which I think was a smart choice. What really took me out of the picture at several occasions though is that they didn\'t follow their own internal rules. We\'re told by our hero that zombies can only shamble slowly, yet not long after, we see zombies running. It\'s like they can have bursts of speed at will. Also, bonies, for some reason, move fast despite being in a more advanced stage of zombification. Also, I know it\'s a short movie, but zombies ""evolve"" too quickly, especially the best friend. Acting was fairly good, not exceptional, but I particularly liked the main character. Why? Because he\'s a nice, smart freak, quite lonely and having trouble to express his feelings in words and actions, but able to be slowly ""healed"" by kindness and love. It made him interesting and relatable to me and probably others. Yes, the movie could even be seen as an allegory on solitude, not fitting in, and how hard it is to truly connect to others in modern society.Zombie makeup was rather minimal, and they managed to make the protagonist kind of attractive, in a goth-like way, mostly because of his great hair and pale blue eyes. I thought there were wasted opportunities with the concept, but it could have been done much, much worse. So, I liked the movie, I would even recommend it to most people not allergic to zombies to see a different take on them. It\'s very minimally bloody and the most ""gory"" part is when they show a zombie shedding his skin to become a bonie, and even that\'s not too disgusting. I think it would make a good date movie. Warm Bodies didn\'t leave me cold and the more I dwell on it, the warmer my feelings for it get.Rating: 7 out of 10 (Good)', ""When I was going to see this movie, i was thinking that it gonna be another teen movie about a girl that's discover the natural identity of her boyfriend, but it wasn't like this, it was so much better, with alternative focus and interesting events this movie comes with a brand new type of history, a very well produced time line that will keep you with your eyes opened until the last second, it's simply awesome, great for family, adaptable for all ages, and will touch even the youngest and the oldest person that goes to see it, it's not a reflexive movie, that will be in your head for a long time, but it's a huge font of entertainment, i recommend it for all the people in the world. Of course, this movie has a lot of existing elements, that make it a little boring to see, but it's a great film for a Saturday night, to see with your friends. Thanks all of you, and sorry about my English, i'm from other country."", ""This movie was great! I brought my friends and they thought it was going to be lame but they ended up loving it just as much as I did! Go see this movie, its adorable! I loved how its dark and gory in a cute way. This movie is funny, suspenseful, a little bit of a horror and romantic; its the perfect date movie! I don't get scared easily but this movie made me jump a few times... The whole movie i was entertained! I was very impressed with the way the make-up and hair team were able to make the zombies so realistic! R was very easy to relate with and this movie has a little bit of everything for everyone. I suggest going even if your a bit skeptic about it. Go out and see this movie!"", ""'Warm Bodies' is a fantastic film about a zombie named 'R' who falls in love with a human and tries his best to protect her from the rest of the zombies.The plot is very strange but if you embrace its weirdness and eccentricity then it is brilliant. A lot of people have described it as being like Twilight except with zombies but it is far better – there's depth to the characters, a lot of really funny and embarrassing scenes but there is also a lot of really frightening parts which I did not expect. I am glad there were some scary moments, with zombies you expect a little scare here and there regardless of the genre but, I am surprised at the films' 12a rating. The plot is well paced and you're not bored or waiting for something interesting to happen – the film entertains you from start to finish.Nicholas Hoult is brilliant in this; it must have been difficult to do this role – especially without blinking most of the time. It's good to see that he is making it in large popular films now because he fully deserves it. Theresa Palmer is also really good; it's nice to see a female lead have some humorous scenes for a change compared to the mind- numbingly dull Bella in Twilight. Dave Franco was also really good here but he was not in the film for very long which is a shame because he can be really funny.Overall, this is a really funny film with a decent amount of horror included. If you are considering taking children between 8 and12 you should know that there are some pretty frightening scenes. There's a fairly small amount of gore but the 'boneys' can be quite scary – particularly towards the end. However, the film is really nice, funny and even heart-warming sometimes."", ""This reviewer was drawn into an early screening designed to generate buzz concerning the worth of the same, so I suppose my end of the deal is to afford such. With this firmly in mind, well - so be it! I rather liked the promotional trailer, drawn as I was to the wry tone and unlikely re-imagining of the zombie genre even as I care little for horror or gore. Fear existed that the premise wouldn't be exploited to the full or that the film would register across just the bits shared in the preview. Such anxieties were misplaced for the film proved consistently entertaining throughout and perhaps better than expected.Much relies upon the capacity of the viewer to accept if not celebrate the understated tone of what is nevertheless an over-the-top zombie picture. The voice over narration provided to us by the 'R' character, affording calm, matter of fact reportage concerning the 'lived experience' of being one of the undead; i.e. charting meaningless time spent will either connect or not connect, where I was pleased to note that the audience in attendance quietly gathered and enjoyed many a little nuance presented for our collective delectation. No one could help by find the tone and direction of this pleasant lark of a date movie anything less than winning. Expect to have a nice time."", ""A genuinely pleasant surprise! Here's a film that takes a dead-on-arrival plot (no pun intended) and turns it into something that is fresh for the uber-popular zombie genre. While the film gets off to a slow start and the acting can be *ahem* stiff at times, we as an audience are invested in this endearing and lovely relationship between the zombie, R, and his living girlfriend, Julie. We want to see them live happily together and survive in the odd, post-apocalyptic conditions that plague their world. I also can't help but dig the nice use of music in this film. Nice work!"", 'In a post-apocalyptic United States of America, the survivors live in a city surrounded by walls that separate them from the living dead. Their leader Grigio (John Malkovich) sends a group of teenagers, including his daughter Julie (Teresa Palmer), her boyfriend Perry (Dave Franco) and her friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton), to the outside to collect food and supplies for the population. However, they are surprised by a group of zombies. Among them, R (Nicholas Hoult), who is a young zombie without recollections but very introspective.R eats Perry\'s brain and revives his memories and sensations with Julie, and he falls in love with her. R saves Julie from the other zombies and hides her in the plane where he lives. Along the days, they develop a weird relationship and become friends. When a group of zombies led by R\'s friend M (Rob Corddry) finds Julie, R protects her. Soon the zombies including R change their emotions and are capable to dream. But the fearful Bonies are seeking out Julie and R to eat them.""Warm Bodies"" is a movie that combines comedy with romance, horror and action genres. The story is brainless since the very beginning; for example, a group of teenagers go to a dangerous environment without any skilled soldier to help them. But the delightful story is worthwhile; the zombie with existential crisis is adorable; Julie comparing R with the cover of Lucio Fulci\'s ""Zombie"" in Blu-Ray is cult; the chemistry and the romance are adorable and in the end I loved this cute movie. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Meu Namorado é um Zumbi"" (""My Boyfriend is a Zombie"")Note: On 01 May 2019, I saw this film again.', 'When we imagine a post-apocalyptic world, it usually includes a lot of broken down buildings, stray dogs and a bunch of raggedy and tough survivors, but rarely zombies! Warm Bodies, rated PG-13, is a hilarious look at what could be, a world in which humans are uncommon and zombies roam the land looking for fresh bodies to eat.This may not sound appealing, but according to 15-year-old KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Raven Devanney, it\'s actually quite hilarious. And if your grandkids aren\'t squeamish about the idea of zombies, then you might consider this film for some mid-winter entertainment. As a quirky romance / comedy / horror film, it stands to remind us of the true meaning of humanity and the importance of staying connected with others.Go here to see Raven\'s full video review! http://www.you-tube.com/watch? v=iDEmy4NlziMWarm Bodies Reviewed by Raven Devanney, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, age 15The newest addition to the Zombie, Romance, Comedy and Horror genre. I call it, a Zombromance, or a Zomedy! It\'s set in a post apocalyptic world consisting of zombies, bonies and a small population of humans. When a zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult) meets a Human girl named Julie, he starts to feel like there is more to life than just being the walking dead. He begins to cure himself, retrain himself to talk and become more human. He inspires more zombies to try to cure themselves, and slowly they begin to become more human. Will R and Julie defy the odds and stay together, or will the fact that one of them is a zombie keep them apart?I absolutely adore this movie. I will definitely see it over and over again. When I think of zombie movies I think of nasty rotting creatures and lots of blood and gore. Naturally the zombies eat people in this movie, but it is filmed in such a way that brought a sense of humor to the whole thing and the blood was very minimal. Even the zombies don\'t look that bad. In fact, Nicholas Hoult makes one attractive zombie! I like the lighting and sets in this film a lot. You can definitely tell that it is a post apocalyptic world, but the zombies still try to maintain somewhat consistent routines. I thought it was cool too see zombie security guards and janitors. Although they weren\'t doing much, you still got the sense that there was some humanity left in them.My favorite character is R because he is such a sweetheart. He goes against his urge to eat people to save Julie and he proves that he is more than just a mindless flesh eater. Even though he is relearning how to speak, he is still quite slow so he can only mutter out simple words and phrases. Nicholas Hoult does a fantastic job keeping this character dull and Zombie-like, while still giving glimpses of his emotions and personality. This movie shows that R still has completely normal thoughts, he just can\'t express them, as if he is trapped in his own mind. R voiced over most of the movie and it was hilarious to hear what he was thinking, compared to what he was actually able to do. He made me laugh even in more intense situations, making him my absolute favorite character.I can\'t say I have a favorite scene because this whole movie is incredibly well done. I do love all the times that R and his Zombie friend M or ""Marcus"" interact. They try to communicate and connect and it\'s so funny and touching to see their friendship show even though it\'s challenging for them to express it. I also really enjoy the seen when Julie (Teresa Palmer) and her friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton) give R a makeover. R is so reluctant to have makeup put on him, which I thought was funny because most teenage boys are. The music in this scene was particularly funny and entertaining and it is a memorable scene.I think there are so many underlying messages in this film, but the one that stands out to me most is that we need to take the time to connect with our surroundings and the people in our lives. In this film it shows a flashback to the world before the zombie outbreak, and R is saying that back then everyone could connect, but in the flashback everyone is on their phones texting or playing video games. It is a really strong reminder that we are so wired and constantly tuned into technology that we often forget to be with our family and connect with our loved onesI recommend this film for ages 13 and up because teens and even adults will love this movie, but kids under the age of 13 may find it to be too mature. I give Warm Bodies 10 out of 10 stars so go check it out at a theater near you!', ""I was looking forward to this since the moment I saw the trailer and so got myself out of bed for the 10:05 am showing on opening day. It looked funny, like 'Shaun of the Dead,' and seemed to have its own interesting take, which is rare in the zombie genre. Usually the plots of zombie films are about as aimless as the zombies. The best way to describe this film is a zombie romantic comedy. It does have some action and some tense moments later on but the initial set up is the zombie, R's, emotional growth and how meeting this girl sparks something in him to evolve. This is nothing like 'Twilight,' and those that are saying that have either not seen it or are too absorbed in the fact that the two leads are good looking, which is the only commonality this film has with 'Twilight.'But, let's face it, the majority of leads in films are attractive, so, that's not much to base a similarity on. 'Shaun of the Dead' was just a comedy, where this is a comedy with heart and depth. It's a satire, but they don't force feed the point of the film, instead they make it very subtle, which is nice.It wasn't a laugh-out-loud comedy, but I don't know that I necessarily thought it would be when I saw the trailer. It definitely had more emotional depth than I thought it would which gave me a much fonder attachment to the film than if it had simply been made for laughs. The two leads had great chemistry and were believable and well cast. The directing, writing, and pretty much everything in the film was well done. I have no complaints. It delivered what it said it would and exceeded my expectations which is rare these days in entertainment."", 'I went to see ""Warm Bodies"" on opening night, something I rarely do. I have to say, I wasn\'t disappointed in this strangely romantic comedy. Don\'t be turned off by the premise of a zombie romantic comedy - it manages to parody human relationships on many levels the way ""Shaun of the Dead"" parodied zombie movies. Nicholas Holt does a wonderful job parodying the awkward teenager filled with angst and a longing to connect, yet his inner dialog makes for much of the movie\'s comedy. He manages to have a bromance and a romance and make you laugh at the same time. Rob Corddry does a wonderful job holding up his end of the bromance if you will, and I didn\'t even catch his part in aiding the Shakespearian nod. Yes, this movie manages to pull a pun on Shakespeare while also light-heartedly setting out themes for what defines a person as human. Teresa Palmer does a wonderful job rounding out the chick flick humor with Analeigh Tipton. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and will be going to see it again. I was too busy laughing to see the plot holes.I also have purposefully avoided reading the book, so I wouldn\'t have any preconceived notions of the movie. I get that the book was much darker than the film, which would set a viewer up for disappointment in a romantic comedy.', 'Here\'s something you don\'t see every day: A romantic comedy involving zombies. Thus, ""Warm Bodies"", a fresh, fast-paced, sensational and truly original delight that is sure to knock your socks off from beginning to end. Start with the premise: After an plague has caused people to turn into zombies, the real humans including General Grigio (John Malkovich) separate themselves from the brain-eating zombies by building up a wall in order to keep them away. Along the way, we get to meet one of those zombies. Meet R (the charming British heartthrob Nicholas Hoult). He doesn\'t quite like this life, knowing that he has to eat brains in order to survive and to live off the memories of the humans he\'s killed. He\'s looking for someone to connect to, which is really explained through his facial expressions and inner monologues. Then it\'s love at first bite, when he\'s finally connecting to Julie (Australian beauty Teresa Palmer), daughter of General Grigio. When he sees her after she shoots most of his friends, he decides to protect her and to ""keep her safe"". Yes, this zombie is in love. Protecting her in his abandoned airplane filled with vinyl records, a record player, and other resourceful things, R finally gets to realize that something was missing in him all along, leaving his heart beating to realize that he loves her. That\'s when R, his friend M (a wonderful Rob Corddry) and the other zombies are starting to change. That\'s all good, until the CG skeletal creatures known as Bonies will do anything to prevent that from happening, which leads off into the film\'s fantastical climax. ""Warm Bodies"", directed by Jonathan Levine (of the delightful comedy-drama ""50/50"" and the incredibly wicked ""The Wackness""), who also adapted the film from Isaac Marion\'s bestselling book for young adults, combines a mixture of 5 different genres (comedy, horror, romance, drama, even a little bit of sci-fi) that makes the film more smarter and even more better than ""The Twilight Saga"". (Take that, Jacob Black.) What also makes it work is the inspired casting of Nicholas Hoult from ""About a Boy"", ""X-men: First Class"" and the upcoming ""Jack the Giant Slayer"". As R, he literally dives deep into the emotions as well as having terrific comic timing through his expressions and his inner monologues by using a spot-on American accent. He also develops great chemistry with Teresa Palmer, known as the butt-kicking alien Six in ""I Am Number Four"", who, as Julie, has a tough and fearless personality as well as a emotional side to her. The supporting cast is also incredible, including Analeigh Tipton, who is hilarious as Julie\'s friend, Nora, Dave Franco (James\'s little brother from last year\'s ""21 Jump Street"") who gets a brief amount of screen time, but really sticks it out as Julie\'s ex-boyfriend, Perry, who (in order not to spoil this) gets called for a dinner date that includes brains on the menu and the great John Malkovich excels as a man who believes that the zombies are nothing more than just flesh-eating corpses looking forward to get shot in the head, but doesn\'t believe that his only daughter is in love with one. I know what you\'re thinking, this is just another zombie movie. But ""Warm Bodies"" is certainly different than that. It revives the zombie genre by bringing something original to the screen. For those who love the TV series ""The Walking Dead"" and the other zombie comedies ""Zombieland"" and ""Shaun of the Dead"", not to mention George A. Romero ""...of the Dead"" series, you actually will get a taste of what the zombie world is like through the eyes of one. And maybe like R\'s, your heart will warm up too. This is the best surprise so far this year. Note: ""Warm Bodies"" is pretty tame, but pushing the envelope for a PG-13 film involving zombies who eats brains and Bonies who consumes hearts. Those are hardly seen, but there are people who shoot zombies in the head with guns. That works in order to keep it very organic.', 'This movie was a lot of fun to watch. It is a twist on the zombie genre unlike anything you have ever seen. There is nothing too offensive or gory in this - the creators kept it clean and not too scary for a full-on zombie flick. There are your typical shot to the head to kill the zombies but those quick scenes are nothing compared to watching 10 minutes of The Walking Dead or the like. I am always concerned because I have seen so many movies over the years where the creators did not know how to properly end the story. So many movies are great the first hour and then end poorly. I thought this had one of the best endings I have ever seen. Enjoy!', ""Wanted to see this film from the moment I saw the trailer at Christmas. I rarely give anything a perfect rating, however, this little gem deserves top marks. I am not a fan of the zombie genre but for the movies message to work, the hero really needs to be a member of the undead. The characters are intriguing and the story is heartwarming, literally! The take away message, or the parable if you will, is that in order to overcome being undead, you have to be human. It is all about relationships and communication, preferably face to face rather than being glued to your smart phone and tweeting your every thought or mundane activity to an electronic cosmos that literally is not a warm body. Will watch this one again and again and can't wait to get the book too!!!""]",19,"['Horror', 'Comedy', 'Romance']"

However as soon as some obviously fake Russian character is introduced with the completely out of place Visotski song playing in the background... the pieces start falling in place. This is a classical American tearjerker feelgood movie. The idea alone of a classic underdog has been made into film 100 times better in Rocky, where not the selfish victory but ""all-in"" attempt at it is what really counts. A battle that could not be won, yet one does not give up. This is the opposite. What could have been a very dramatic (and believable! and almost heartbreaking!) plot of two brothers pitted against each other is washed down the tubes. For someone who has a moderate interest in MMA it is clear the the ending was completely unrealistic and would have never taken place. This is not 1900\'s, today people are not beaten to within an inch of their life in the ring. To contrast this to any VanDamme flick - think of this movie being a much better attempt at a fighter movie, minus actual fighters who have no acting skills, but add to it American superiority complex and you have the ""warrior"". Overrated, and sad to say this ""warrior"" won in the ring but lost to idealism.', ""Oh boy! We've got yet another Rocky movie, this time written by an over-the-top hardship pornographer.

Really, this film just rehashes all those old 1970s buttons and levers to try to make us root for the fighter and his noble cause. There's nothing new here and in a year or so it will have slipped from the top 250 to a more reasonable middle-of-the-pack seat on the list.Most sports movies have a set pattern to some extent and almost invariably involve an underdog, a villain, and a subplot of some family issue.

This one just drags on and on and on and it's so unbelievably boring that you would have to be a warrior to stay awake. I think spending 2 hours watching grass grow would have a better plot.

Well, if that\'s your opinion you haven\'t watched a lot of movies in you\'r life (or maybe you\'re an ex marine?).You will enjoy a couple fights, but get ready to be disappointed.', ""Despite what you may have heard or read, Warrior just may be one of the most melodramatic and manipulative films ever conceived. Yes, it is a sports movie and gets a pass from most people because of the genre's varied history. But that is not nearly a good enough excuse for the dreck that Gavin O'Connor has helped concoct with this film. The Conlon family has been irreparably damaged after years of abuse at the hands of the former boxer and alcoholic patriarch Paddy (Nick Nolte). He is trying his hand at sobriety, but his estranged son Brendan (Joel Edgerton) is not ready to let Paddy get too close to his family. Other son Tommy (Tom Hardy) has just mysteriously returned from fighting in the Middle East, and recruits Paddy to help train him as an MMA fighter in order to compete in an upcoming tournament with the best fighters in the world. At the same time, Brendan, a school teacher, begins training to fight in the same tournament in order to keep a roof over his family's heads.Should the trailer not have told you already, it becomes increasingly obvious throughout Warrior's often excruciating 140-minute running time where these two brothers are heading. The film makes no bones about it, and plays through almost every single underdog trope you can imagine and even a few you may have forgotten. The notion of being subtle was apparently lost on O'Connor, and I wonder if the original script played out just as annoying and silly as the film does. The comparisons to Rocky are more than fair, because the movie practically rips off entire segments right out of that legendary Oscar winner without shame. But looking aside from the formulaic and absolutely asinine plotting structure, as well as the clear jumps in logic on the parts of almost every single cast member (specifically towards the end of the film), I think the film is most guilty of being too long, too self-indulgent and just plain boring. Warrior lacks the charisma and finesse needed to really make you forget the predictability of it all and actually care about the plight of these characters. It beats you over the head with moments dripping with pathos and sorrow, but never answers the question of why you should care. It merely goes through the motions, playing out lengthy scenes that could have easily been cut for pacing or reworked to give us a reason for watching the struggles of this collapsed family. It fails to connect on almost every level, and merely feels like a stretched out, half-baked drama that drags its heels getting to the tournament the film is building towards. Even then, it still takes its time getting to the fights. I dig Hardy as an actor and look forward to seeing him truly break out, but he does not really put any effort into Tommy. He is brooding and conceited throughout, hinting at an inner pain that is waiting to be unleashed. But he never really gets the opportunity to showcase any of it. He spends most of the movie not saying a word, and merely looking at the camera or his cast mates with saddened and hollowed eyes. His sad eyes can only do so much, and his dialogue does absolutely nothing. It looks like he took the movie merely for the chance to bulk up and prep for The Dark Knight Rises. Edgerton, who I also look forward to seeing break out, does a little better. He actually puts in the effort needed to be convincing, and even with the atrocious dialogue, comes off as genuine. He takes even the worst of moments in stride, and does almost the entirety of the heavy lifting in the film. Should the film have focused entirely on him and cut out the silly brother subplot, I think it could have worked a whole lot better.Which brings me to Nolte, who gives what is likely his best performance in over a decade. While that may be true, I find it hard to find anything to really praise about it. He appears to be playing a fragmented archetype along the lines of Mickey Rourke's character in The Wrestler. Both characters are washed up shadows of their former selves, and not surprisingly, the lives of the actors playing them mirror the roles. But instead of giving the emotional breadth and genuine authenticity needed for this character, Nolte overacts the entire way through it. He hams it up for part of the film, and in others, completely destroys any semblance of attempting to give a great performance. Instead of letting it flourish, he seems more concerned with ensuring everyone know what kind of thespian he can be when he wants to be, and ends up becoming comically bad in some scenes. When there are people laughing at your character's most deadly serious scene, not because it is funny but because the delivery is stilted and amateur, it says a lot about the character and even more about your work.But for all of its problems and everything it does so horrifically wrong, the fight scenes at the end of the film are simply magnificent. They are raw and realistic. You can feel every punch, gasp at every bone crunching submission, and practically smell the sweat coming off the mat. You can sense immediately that great pains were taken to ensure these scenes looked as authentic as possible. You become immersed in them, and feel like you are right there in the scene. Not surprisingly, I completely forgot how long I had been sitting watching Warrior because these scenes were just so breathlessly entertaining. But after wading through almost two hours of melodramatic pandering, I think they deserved to be.4/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com)."", ""This is the typical fight film formula, the underdog fighter comes from the bottom of the heap to make it big. Other reviewers have compared it favorably to two other famous fight films, Rocky and Million Dollar Baby. Those movies had exciting fights, involvement in the characters, and entertaining plots. Unfortunately Warrior has none of these. Most of the fights are really short, usually lasting a few seconds and the climactic fight is not real exciting (but not bad). I couldn't really get too involved with the characters and in fact could care less about them. There's not that much of a plot line and what there is is not that involving.I'm not saying that this movie is a total zero, it's just not that great. If you want to see better fight movies then rent Rocky or Million Dollar Baby.I am aware that many others are giving much more positive reviews of this movie than I am giving it. Rarely do I differ that much with the reviews that others give. I can only describe things as I see them. I can not see how people could leave the theater crying unless it is from being upset after having paid money to see this."", ""A very cliché sports story, with so many corny moments that you'll have seen in six dozen other films that it becomes ludicrous long before its end. Yet, in some ways, it's pretty well done, and it nearly overcomes those clichés. Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy play two brothers who parted ways way back when they were teenagers. Hardy went away with his mother and later joined the Marines after she passed away. Now he has returned to his father (Nick Nolte), a former drunk who drove his family apart. Edgerton didn't like his father much, either, but chose not to go with his brother and mother because he was in love with the woman he would eventually marry (Jennifer Morrison). Both brothers are skilled fighters and have their eyes set on the big prize in a mixed martial arts tournament. The film somewhat succeeds because it's very low-key. Most of the time, it's hard to notice how melodramatic and predictable the story is. The performances help, too (Joel Edgerton was my favorite of the three big characters). After a while, though, we get stuff like a wife who refuses to watch the fight impatiently pacing behind her cell phone, on a table in the foreground, waiting for a call to tell her her husband has won a match. And Hardy's story is beyond ridiculous - he gets invited to the tournament after beating up a trained MMA champion in a local gym - never mind that Hardy, at best, was just a trained wrestler many years ago in high school. Being in the Marines does not give you superpowers. That's just the start of the ridiculousness that ends up, obviously, with the two brothers fighting in the ring (with Edgerton's wife, at this point, of course watching from ringside). I should probably call Gavin O'Connor one of the best directors of the year, because, as over-the-top as all this stuff is (and, believe me, I barely scratched the surface - the movie runs for 2 hours and 20 minutes), it generally doesn't feel that way. If one doesn't look too closely at it, I could imagine it seeming great. But it's not."", ""My first glance, I thought it's gonna be like The Fighter since this film is about fighting sports and there's a brother relationship. But here, the brothers are against to each other. The film doesn't really spend so much time dealing with their relationship. It mostly goes to the father of the main leads. The film is unnecessarily long but the third act has plenty of exciting MMA fights. If you're expecting this to be like The Fighter then you'll be disappointed. But Warrior has its own drama piece.What's intriguing about this film is the idea of making these brothers fight on a match. Most of the film is an exposition to their lives. Telling what happened to them from the past and bringing a lot of emotions. There are only few scenes of Tommy and Brendan being together but all we know they're against to each other. It's a family struggle.When it comes to the third act, it's all about the fighting. The fighting is pretty exciting. It's also too suspenseful because the first 90 minutes of the film is getting to know these characters. Fans of MMA and UFC will enjoy the whole third act. No matter what, Tom Hardy is always awesome. The film has plenty of heart and emotions. Most of these goes to Nick Nolte. He made all of his scenes compelling. I think Joel Edgerton is bland but his fighting is pretty good.I'm a bit disappointed after watching this because I thought it's gonna be like The Fighter but still this is pretty good. More darker but not quite better though. The action is better. If there is one thing that is similar to The Fighter then that probably be the filmmaking. The camera's shaky, a little music score, but a whole lot of style. Well, this is not True Story but the drama works mostly to the scenes of Nick Nolte. Since he nails most of the drama, Hardy and Edgerton nails the action. Warrior has a lot of emotions and a bit of bromance."", ""I had the pleasure of seeing Warrior at 2011 CinemaCon, walking in not knowing a thing about the movie, other than it was a movie about 'fighting.' And though a MMA movie (Mixed Martial Arts), not boxing, per se, for the genre, fighting, Warrior delivers a much better story than The Fighter, and is on par with Clint Eastwood's Oscar winner, Million Dollar Baby.Expect a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nod in 2012 for Nick Nolte. And superstar status for Tom Hardy.Warrior, though a work of fiction, plays out like a true story; two brothers at odds with each other and their father, in the town of Pittsburgh, who resort to prize fighting, one for the money, the other to prove himself a man."", 'Every so often you\'ll come across a combat sport movie that manages to find just the right balance of drama and action – that is, more drama than action. When fights are justified with backstories full of crushing emotion, they become all the more intense and gratifying. Warrior brings to the table the world of mixed martial arts, where punches, kicks, holds, and everything else goes. The inception of new international tournament ""Sparta"" puts on a collision course Paddy (Nick Nolte), Brendan (Joel Edgerton), and Tom Conlon (Tom Hardy), all part of an estranged family torn apart in the past by abuse, favoritism, and abandonment. Tom resurfaces in society to enlist the help of his formerly alcoholic father Paddy to train him for the tournament, while at the same time Brendan revisits his UFC training in hopes to win the $5 million purse for his struggling family. The two underdogs face some of the toughest MMA fighters on the planet, but the true struggle appears to lie within them. Paddy battles for forgiveness against the resentment of his sons, Tom fights to prove to himself that he is strong, and Brendan struggles to come to terms with his older family while trying to support one of his own.The fantastic thing here is two protagonists entering the same tournament. Each brother has his own respectable reasons for fighting, a fact that is sure to divide the audience when it comes time to choose which one to root for. The story truly is gut-wrenchingly powerful and presented in an engaging fashion. Little by little through the film\'s dialogue, we are allowed a glimpse into the past hardships of the Conlon family, and the characters\' motivations for retaining such hatred are revealed gradually. Through the incredible acting talents of Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton, and Nick Nolte, this confused and passionate chemistry really comes alive. All three actors put up some of the most convincing and heartbreaking performances of their careers; and seeing as how The Fighter garnered so many Oscar nominations, I can\'t see why Warrior will not do the same. My only beef with the movie is its clichéd climax and rather bleak inconclusive ending, though it still does good to the emotional schism the movie intended to create. Warrior is one of those sports films with a magical mixture of emotional and physical battle. It\'s a wonderful story showing how sometimes the world\'s strongest forces are insignificant in comparison to the troubles of a scarred family. Warrior is without a doubt worth a visit to the theater. One of the best of 2011! And whether you\'re an MMA fan or not, the adrenaline-pumping fights will have you up and cheering and applauding.9/10']",12,"['Action', 'Drama']"
Water for Elephants,3.97,4.33,"['Drama', 'Romance']","Set in the 1930s, a former veterinary student takes a job in a travelling circus and falls in love with the ringmaster's wife.",joy,"['""Water for Elephants"" is a flat soap opera lacking flair or heart or even coherence. It\'s a love story set in a Depression-era circus; how could it be so boring? Direction and miscasting. Director Francis Lawrence never milks the Depression or the circus setting. He directs as if in the suburban living and bedrooms of television\'s Pine Valley. You never get the sense of how a Depression-era, small-town kid would be thrilled, terrified, and curious seeing a lion or an elephant for the first time. There are a couple of what appear to be CGI shots of a train chugging across moonlit landscapes; even these lack magic.Robert Pattinson, star of the teen-vampire sensation ""Twilight,"" is miscast as Jacob, the lead character, a circus vet. Pattinson displays the skills necessary to make teenage girls swoon: he pouts, he broods, he is self-absorbed, he makes zero intellectual or psychological demands on his audience. He has heavy brows and lots of hair. These skills deserve respect. They cause teen girl fans to post reviews of his work that end in multiple exclamation points!!!!!!! But Pattinson is in so far over his head in ""Water for Elephants"" all you see of him, in some scenes, are bubbles on the surface as he sinks into invisibility.Reese Witherspoon is a crisp and perky professional with shiny hair and perfect teeth. Problem is, she\'s playing Marlena, an orphan trick horse rider who marries an abusive circus boss, August (Christoph Waltz.) Marlena should exude desperate vulnerability combined with manipulative power, the kinky raw sex appeal of a woman who, scantily clad in skin-tight, revealing costumes, performs suggestive tricks with muscly animals in front of applauding throngs. Witherspoon doesn\'t even try to bring that Marlena to life. She just plays Reese Witherspoon, professional movie star with flawless hair and teeth, a little bit bored as Oprah interviews her. There\'s nothing of the abusive orphanage, the poor street, the skanky Big Top about her at all.Robert Pattinson\'s Jacob and Reese Witherspoon\'s Marlena have zero chemistry. They are the least sexy screen couple I\'ve ever seen. Al Gore and Bill Clinton had more chemistry. When they do kiss, it\'s not that long-awaited, thrilling moment of release. It\'s ""Huh?"" Christoph Waltz as August, the circus owner, is from a completely different, much better, movie. People are going to walk out of this film wishing that they could have seen the movie centered around Christoph Waltz\'s August. Waltz demands the audience\'s attention in a way that no one else in the film does, except Tai as the elephant, Rosie. Waltz\'s nuanced performance brings to life an August who is very complex and worth caring about, despite his being a monster.It\'s clear that Sara Gruen, the book\'s author, and the filmmaker wanted to tell a story that featured lots of animals. The plot is a cobbled-together, soulless bit of scaffolding on which to hang shots of circus animals and shallow depictions of circus rituals. Why is Jacob a Polish speaker? Why is the elephant a speaker of Polish? Most Polish immigrants to the US at this time were descendants of recently liberated serfs, and did very harsh manual labor in the US: coal mining, steel, cleaning. It\'s very unlikely that a Polish speaker would be an Ivy League veterinary school graduate. In any case, the film makes no use of Jacob\'s ethnicity. He could as easily be Spanish or Italian or Greek. Why would a man who had the focus and self-discipline to complete an Ivy League veterinary school education toss aside, literally, everything he has worked for, and everything he owns, to jump on a passing train? The moment utterly lacks verisimilitude and psychological depth. It\'s obvious that the film just wants to get to its circus setting and animals. Jacob is just a pawn. Why is the film told as an old man\'s flashback? That approach, and the voice-over narration, add nothing to the film.', 'Due to the preordained success of ""Water For Elephants"", which really should have been called ""Whiskey for Elephants,"" 20th Century Fox has already released the title of its two sequels, ""Food for Giraffes"" and the cautionary prequel""Fish for Tacos"".While were on the subject Robert Pattinson ruined what was otherwise a half decent movie by bringing absolutely nothing to the table. His game plan in every frame? A smirk or a constipated look; he alternates between the two throughout the film, and sometimes, when he decides to try really hard, combines them in the same shot. The Elephant carries more emotional weight in the movie than he does. In every seen the elephant was in I wanted to yell ""Will someone please feed the poor thing and let her drink some water."" On the other hand Pattinson\'s presences made me want to see the film recast with an actual actor in his roll. When you have such good actors in most every other roll, you have to look at Pattinson and wonder if that was the Directors first, second, or even third choice for that part, my guess is no. If Francis Lawrence can get a half decent scene out of Will Smith in front of CG vampires then the fact that he can\'t get Pattinson to do something besides look like he\'s about to mess himself in front of real people feels more like Pattinson\'s shortfall as an actor than Lawrence\'s as a director. This is not to say the movie isn\'t without other flaws, it\'s pretty emotionally weightless in its depiction of romance and sympathy for its main character; mainly by fault of Pattinson\'s inability to lead the cast. However some blame must also be placed on poor pacing at the beginning of the film. Lawrence doesn\'t linger on the big emotional scene that gets the movie going at all, it\'s mostly voice over and a brief shot of Pattinson\'s feet and then off to the train. Never mind that your parents just died, you don\'t look nearly as shattered or upset as you should. Lawrence uses way to much emotional short-hand in these early scenes and it undercuts the impact and weight of the material. The short lead- in to the past at the very beginning of the movie falls flat as well. Hal Holbrook\'s take on Old Jacob falls short because he also lacks convection and weight in his words. Both of the actors playing Jacob bring the movie down.I have heard rumors that Pattinson was sick while the movie was shooting, this doesn\'t surprise me; he was probably scarred silly to be in a film with actors who are way beyond his range. Most of the real human emotion in the movie comes from the viewer\'s own anger at watching the animal cruelty by Christoph Waltz\'s character more than from anything going on between Pattinson and Witherspoon. Witherspoon and Waltz put on a good show but Pattinson weighs them down; the main attraction makes the show feel like a scam, welcome to the circus.', 'This was one of the oldest stories in the book -- a new man gets in between the relationship of a husband and a wife. But for ""Water for Elephants,"" this story was transported to the era of the Great Depression in the US where a young vet student joins a traditional big top circus, led by its perfectionist ringleader and his star performer wife.I guess period set pieces like this would only appeal to certain people. I did not find the time or the setting particularly interesting. The presence of the the titular elephant Rosie was engaging though, as the beast actually seemed to emote. Christoph Waltz does another one of his charming sadist roles as August, the ringleader. Reese Witherspoon impressed me with some of her gymnastic skills as Marlena, but overall her performance was rather bland. Most of the audience attention was on Robert Pattinson to see if he can step out of Edward\'s shadow in the Twilight movies. Interestingly, he plays a character named Jacob in this film. He has very distinct facial features which makes it hard for him to disappear into a role. He was able to show more variety here, and he looked right for the time period. It is still very much in the love story genre though, so his acting style is generally the same. So the final verdict is: If you like love stories, you might like this movie. If you like the circus, you might like this movie. Despite all the rave reviews I have been reading about it, I found this film rather average because of the very familiar and therefore predictable storyline.', 'I saw the film in South Africa on Friday afternoon - The trailer was an attractive, appealing one which made the film look intriguing; promising a sweeping period story and an epic romance. ""Water for Elephants"" certainly isn\'t unwatchable. However, it lacks any serious emotional power, Robert Pattinson (so effectively cast in the ""Twilight"" movies) is a good looking, and interesting looking, guy, but he definitely isn\'t a great actor. Pattinson fails to create a three dimensional character. One never sees what is going on in Jacob\'s head, because Pattinson isn\'t capable of projecting internal emotions. Reese Witherspoon - who can act - is miscast. Christopher Waltz - who was really well cast in ""Inglourous Basterds"" is certainly entertaining to watch and I would attribute some of the failings of his colorful character to the script rather than his acting ability.The ""chocolate box"" cinematography is pleasant, colorful and sometimes atmospheric, rather than brilliant, and the film never really gets into top gear. Like its leading man, it\'s nice looking, but lacking in real substance. The narrative structure is also lumpy, and the story doesn\'t flow naturally. The best acting in the picture is done by Hal Holbrook and Paul Schneider in relatively small roles. But, to be honest, Rosie the elephant is easily the most endearing character in the film. While the film was disappointing and is certainly not an out and out flop, the story has been dumbed-down to appeal to a teenage demographic. It\'s got no real sexual or romantic heat. But, funny enough, I think youngsters will enjoy it. Especially teenage girls. I just hoped for so much more. No wonder 20th Century Fox are keeping it away from the critics for as long as possible, and opening it in a few smaller territories before the States. It ain\'t going to pick up sparkling reviews.Don\'t think I hated it though, I just expected and hoped for so much more. The film\'s ending is a wee bit anti-climactic, but then the romantic part of the storyline is so predictable that it could hardly have ended any other way. I was, however, touched - little tears even welled up in my eyes - by the scene involving the horse\'s tragic demise, and a scene involving Rosie being hurt by Waltz\'s August. The costumes and period details are good, (although things sometimes look a wee bit too glamorous considering the milieu it plays out in), but the dialog and body language of the actors feels too contemporary. I imagine, given the film\'s target demographic, and the marketing campaign - which is centered around Pattinson, that this was intentional.The story, while interesting enough (not surprising, since it is based on a popular novel), never really gathers an epic sweep, not is it ever intimate enough to compensate for this. Mostly, it just lacks the genuine romantic heat to succeed fully. There is virtually no erotic chemistry or tension between Pattinson and Witherspoon. So serious, passionate adult cinema-goers looking for intelligent, emotionally resonant fare will be disappointed, but maybe it will work for ""Twilight"" fans, if you know what I mean. The teenage girls will like it, and their boyfriends won\'t mind it. I must say, though, as a 51-year-old adult male who works in the DVD industry, writes film reviews for local publications and watches over a 100 films a year on the big screen (plus another 400 or so on DVD), I am hardly the target demographic, so, depending on age, tastes and how seriously they take cinema-going, others might well enjoy it more than me. Those young viewers who are looking for lightweight escapism with a pretty, contemporary star in the male lead will probably forgive the film its lack of genuine dramatic tension, and a compelling narrative structure.Like I say, I really expected more from this film, but I guess so many of today\'s films are tailored to a teen aged democratic who lack the ability to concentrate for long periods of time, want fast editing and are not interested in seeing characters breathe or develop in interesting, realistic ways.', 'Critically acclaimed novel ""Water for Elephants"" written by Sara Gruen was a New York Times #1 Best Seller in 2007 and now has taken a turn towards cinema with the help of Director Francis Lawrence (""I Am Legend""). The film\'s biggest draw comes from Robert Pattinson (""Twilight"") after his tween vampire film following success, however, the real star of the show is Academy Award Winner Christoph Waltz (Inglourious Bastards""). Reese Witherspoon (""Walk the Line"") stars as the film\'s leading lady hitting her stride late in the film. Hal Holbrook (""All The President\'s Men"") opens up the film with the portrayal of present day Jacob Janowski found in a parking lot outside of the circus who begins telling the story of his early years connecting to one of the biggest circus disasters in history. Pattinson plays the younger Jacob, a veterinary student at Cornell whose his life is turned upside down. He drops out of school deciding to go jump a train. He realizes that he has joined the ranks of the Benzini Brothers Circus changing his life forever. He is thrown into the harsh reality of the Big Top meeting a man named August (Waltz) who reluctantly gives him a job working with the animals. Jacob becomes infatuated with August\'s wife Marlena (Witherspoon) who is a part of the lead act in the show that develops into a friendship between man, woman and a majestic elephant. However, life is a battle and the story is extremely dramatic leaving everyone\'s life at risk with August\'s alcoholic greedy rage on their doorstep.Cristoph Waltz does what he does best with his most recent interpretation of a complicated ill-willed bad guy that audiences grow to hate, however, the depth of his performances make him memorable. He is able to give life to the cold soul of August making the viewer root for his demise along with his change of heart. Pattinson shows that he is more than just a tween king vampire, however, his full potential is not unleashed. The real star of the show is the majestic elephant herself (Rosie) and the character\'s journey to protect her hitting the right notes in the second half.The magic and magnificence of the film is lost within the overly dramatic, lengthy exposition. The melodramatic backdrop of the film is omnipresent leaving little room for comic relief and the growth of the beautiful creatures to coexist. The most disappointing part of the film is Witherspoon\'s odd character development making her very plain until halfway through the film. At the same time it seems like an eternity once the elephant finally enters the film showing an inkling of hope, while the love triangle becomes childish, cliché and eventually annoying.Overall, the film has an average script that is aided by the performances of its actors. It is hard to overlook the melodrama as Waltz controls the show, which is actually more about life and relationships than the circus.', 'Having read a few reviews of this depression era set novel by Sara Gruen, I was apprehensive to see the film. The readers and critics had said it was too depressing and didn\'t end well. I\'m happy to say the film is not bad at all. It captures the mood of the 1930s, and we the audience really get a sense of what it must have been like to live in that time in history. (Yes we went through our own depression but it was quite different and much more difficult back then.) The film centers around Jacob (Robert Pattinson) a student of veterinary science at Cornell, who gives up his education and runs away after his parents die in a car accident. He stumbles upon a traveling circus, where he is taken in by riff raffs and other stowaways. They have all become a part of the circus ensemble in order to make ends meet. Jacob eventually meets their ringleader August, played by Christolph Waltz (Inglorious Basterds) and his beautiful wife Marlena (Reese Witherspoon). August takes Jacob under his wing initially, but later Jacob learns his true colors. I do not wish to give away too much of the storyline but something tells me people will like this movie as much as the book if not more. I think the film makers have managed to make a film about the depression era without it being depressing. The film has an epic feel to it. It\'s, emotional, inspiring, romantic, and overall it makes for a very good drama. Even the ending is uplifting. The cast is wonderful as well. Robert Pattinson holds his own against two Oscar winners. It\'s great to see Reese Witherspoon back in action and in top form. There aren\'t enough great things I can say about Christoph Waltz. He balances the line between being dangerous and comedic with razor sharp precision, and is very intimidating\x85his performance is brilliant. It\'s great to see a film with real sets, and gritty and flawed characters, rather than imaginative CG rendered places and creatures. Even the train, (where a large part of the film takes place) feels alive with all its moving parts\x85it has a personality of its own. It\'s a surprising film from director Francis Lawrence whose previous films include ""Constantine"" and ""I am Legend."" It\'s clear that the team he works with has a great sense of capturing a story\'s mood, time, and place. ""Water for Elephants"" is a beautiful, moving, and entertaining film. Go see it! http://tickingticket.blogspot.com/', 'OK, I\'ll try to tell you a bit of what I thought about ""Water for Elephants"", without spoiling anything. I have not read the novel (even though I plan to do it now) so I\'m only offering my views on the movie.First of all: It\'s amazingly beautiful. The costumes and sets are gorgeous, the cinematography is exquisite, the animals are cute (especially Rosie the elephant) and the three leads are very easy on the eyes as well. Robert Pattinson was actually quite good. This was a surprise to me, since I didn\'t really think he was anything special in any of the Twilight movies or ""Remember Me"". He looked very appropriate for the time the movie was set in, and even though I love Emile Hirsch (who auditioned for Jacob too) I\'m confident that Robert was the best choice there was for this role, it was perfect for him. Hal Holbrook was also very fitting for the role of older Jacob. The two actors really made me believe that they were the same person in different stages of his life.Reese Witherspoon was okay. She looked beautiful, was charming and cute but it felt like something was missing - however, I can\'t think of any other actress I would have liked better in the role, so I came to the conclusion that it was probably the character Marlena that was a little bland, not Reese. But the true star of this movie was Christoph Waltz. I may be a bit biased since I loved him in ""Inglorious Basterds"", but he was even more perfect in this movie. His portrayal of August was amazing, he made him likable and interesting and I was always compelled by his scenes. The character reminded me a lot of Miles in ""King Kong"" (played by Jack Black), a character that also wanted fame and success more than anything and used questionable and even cruel methods to get it. He was terrifying in some scenes too, but always believable. Also, in the beginning of the movie i really felt the chemistry between August and Marlena, which made the character even more interesting; however, I did feel like Jacob and Marlena had chemistry too, and in my opinion this way it was more realistic (both men loved her and she also cared about both of them). I loved the movie, and I really recommend it to everyone. I would sincerely give it 10/10 stars. Of course there was some parts of the movie I didn\'t like (particularly towards the end of it), but overall it was a magical, spectacular and epic period movie, and I can\'t wait to see it again!', ""How to summarize this movie? How does one write about the magic you experienced? I do not know where to begin. The movie took me by storm, it was so fantastically well-made, colors, scenes, it captured one and brought one back to 1930 century magical, but oh so dark circus life. Robert impressed in his role and enchanted me once again. By his side was Reese as spectacular as she always is, beautiful, seductive and fragile. Their forbidden love and passion was captivating. But the movies big star in my opinion was Rosie, the stunning elephant. Could not help but to wish for my own Rosie.The movie was wonderful in every way, romance, passion, action, tragedy, joy, yes, everything you can imagine. A different story (although it starts as the Titanic and has a similar feel) that enchanted me. I still can't stop thinking about the movie.Must be seen!"", 'Water For Elephants got released here a full week ahead of the US and first let me indulge in the joy of being able to review such a highly anticipated film before my fellow American film-loving counterparts.The film completely fulfilled my expectations. It is a well scripted, meticulously shot and finely acted period drama, the likes of which are increasingly less to come by at the movies these days. A big congratulations to all those involved with the production for having the confidence to delve into this venture. Actually I am very curious about its box-office. Last year was a surprisingly profitable year for adult dramas and if that is any indication, this fine film should continue the same trend.Water For Elephants really impresses with the production design, atmosphere, costumes and stunts. Most of the time I felt like I was watching a classic film made during the studio era; it looked that authentic and faultless. The three main actors all seem satisfied for having such meaty parts and deliver more than satisfactory performances. Robert Pattinson shines and proves that he is capable as a serious actor. Reese Witherspoon has always been a true professional and here with her stunts demonstrates that again. She also fits surprisingly well to the 1930s platinum blonde beauty type. Christopher Waltz is a wonderful actor and here it becomes very clear that his success in Inglorious Basterds was not a one-off. The story is very emotional and while it touches the heart romantically, it also manages to lay down a heretofore unseen dark aspect of old era circus entertainment in particular and also crowd entertainment as a whole. I almost wished for a three hour epic after it ended; it left me wanting more. The whole thing was really interesting.All in all a wonderful and deeply satisfying experience at the movies, well worth every dime. Go see it so that adult dramas of this caliber (in terms of star power, production budget and subsequent attention to detail) could continue to be made.', ""Although the title of this review pretty much sums it up, in order to post a review i must include 10 lines of text. So here goes. This movie starts out with a similar feel to Titanic like many have said. It takes you back 70+ years and takes you through and incredible journey of passion, adventure, and just life in general. For every up there is a down, for every laugh a cry. You find yourself full of emotion at so many points in this movie it's hard to not get chills at times. The ending is well written well acted out and well, like the rest of the movie is just perfect. How this is only @ a 6.3 rating currently is beyond me, hopefully more people will take the time to post this movie was a solid 8.5 in my opinion and is a must see."", ""I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Without being trite and redundant, it explores timeless and universal themes such as finding one's destiny and freedom, life choices, love, and jealousy, put in an interesting setting, that is the circus world -- the early 1900s when the US prohibition and depression were taking place -- which is nicely recreated on screen (by production designer Jack Fisk who's mostly known for his work with Terence Malick and David Lynch). Based on Sara Gruen's novel, this very original story is beautifully told, uses classical film-making techniques -- its camera moves, staging, lighting, pacing, usage of 'live' animals, stunts and special effects -- and well acted -- Robert Pattison comes across as a decent lead actor and not just a pretty face; Reese Witherspoon, very convincing as the star circus girl, doing some of her own stunts; however Christoph Waltz's performance stands out the most as he maintains the dynamic among all the main characters and fuels the drama. It's nice and refreshing to see a classically-made-and-looking film coming out of Hollywood."", ""Readers, fear not. This is one adaption that lives up to the book.Water for Elephants is pure beauty. Despite the fact that it takes place during the Depression, it makes you almost wish you lived during the '30s.One reason is the costumes. They are wonderfully done, as well as the makeup. Another is the eye candy. No, I'm not talking about Robert Pattinson(though he looks as gorgeous as ever). I'm talking about the breathtaking cinematography, courtesy of Rodrigo Prieto.While the leads(Robert Pattinson, Reese Witherspoon, Christoph Waltz) all turn in GREAT performances, the real star here is Tai the elephant. She plays Rosie, the newest addition to The Benzini Bros. Most Spectacular Show on Earth, who is brought in in hopes of taking The Benzini Bros. circus to a new level(particularly to the level of Ringling Bros.).As per usual, there are quite a few changes that may or may not irritate the readers. It all depends on the person. One that I felt was an improvement upon the book, however, was the combining of August and Uncle Al. I honestly didn't miss Al one bit.Water for Elephants is a beautiful, enchanting, mesmerizing must-see."", 'Remember when movies were glamorous (and not in 3-D)... when the stars were beautiful, and no one had to fornicate on screen for you to know they were walking on clouds or heart-achingly in love? Remember when quiet, wordless scenes could make tears well up in your eyes? Well, whoever may say ""They don\'t make em like they used to"" hasn\'t seen ""The Painted Veil"" or this beautiful film, ""Water for Elephants"". This is old-style adventure and romance --Hollywood film-making at its finest!I didn\'t read the novel, but I am an avid fan of classic films, and an animal lover, and I highly recommend ""Water for Elephants"" for most anyone (who is at least in their teens.) The only critique I have of this movie is that it was too short! It was so beautiful and it carried me away so completely, I think I could have enjoyed it for another hour.""Water for Elephants"" sweeps you into circus life of the 1930\'s, during the hungry and desperate times of the Great Depression. It\'s a nomadic, hard-working, and very sparse life. This 2nd class circus is a defined ""family"" though, and they live isolated on the sullied fringes of regular society.All three leads were truly luminous. Jacob and Marlena were both lovely and believable in their restrained, refined roles.Christoph Waltz, as August, proved again he can be an ""enigma absolute."" He is charismatic and likable; his enthusiasm and joy is literally tangible, but somewhere beneath, there seems to lurk something so horrific, there simply aren\'t words to name it.I have so much admiration for the magic of this Christoph Waltz after ""Inglourious Basterds"" and now, this new film. It is my great hope that he will choose his roles wisely and with delicacy, so that we can continue to relish in his talents for many years to come.My virtual hat is off! Off to the writer, cinematographer, set director, art director, director, editors, costume designer, and everyone involved. ""Water for Elephants"" is a can\'t-help-but-watch-it-again movie masterpiece with music by talented James Newton Howard that will make you tap your feet one minute and then want to cry the next.Hal Holbrook, Paul Schneider, James Frain, Mark Povinelli, and more! Wow. What outstanding work by supporting actors, and what fine casting! Hal Holbrook EASILY was old Jacob to Robert Pattinson\'s young Jacob. That\'s so hard to do, and yet, it was so easily done here.The animal actors were first-class, too; Silver Star, Rosie, and Queenie were all achingly touchable and sweet.Romantic, sweeping, frightening and sometimes violent --this film is TRUE-to-life while still being BIGGER-than-life.Its tag line is ""Life is the most spectacular show on earth"", and once you\'ve seen the film, it\'s the perfect statement.So yes, go ahead and compare it to any of the old-style Hollywood grand classics. It deserves the acclaim and the adoration. I\'ll go see it again while it\'s still on the big screen!', ""First off I bought this book the day it came out because of the author's previous too books she had written. This is by far my favorite book and was excited and apprehensive to see the movie. The movie does move parts of the book around and it does leave things out. From my stand point everything about it was stunning. Pleasantly surprised by Robert Pattinson's performance, he made an impressive Jacob. Reese was gorgeous as usual and captivating as Marlena, but Christopher Waltz was by far my favorite. He was the perfect August. This movie is just absolutely stunning and I agree with some of the previous posters, how is this movie only reaching a 6.3 rating? I suppose people just need more motivation to see it on their own! :-)"", ""Water For Elephants takes us back in time, not just because it is set in the 30's but also because the movie is filmed with such quality and attention to detail, it is very much like movies used to be made. No reliance on CGI or profanity to make up for lack of imagination either. The dialog is crisp and the film adheres very much to the spirit of the book, even if things were consolidated or omitted for the film.The cinematography is lush and if the film doesn't win an award for it, it will be a travesty.And the performances are wonderful. Christoph Waltz is captivating as a complex character and Reese Witherspoon walks a fine line (no pun intended) between the role of a dutiful wife and that of a survivor. But it is Robert Pattinson who delivers a range of emotion not seen from him before. He is understated and again reminds me of actors of old - Gary Cooper specifically. He plays a gentleman and a scholar but also shows passion and intensity. Any doubt viewers might have had on his abilities as an actor are wiped away, as he more than holds his own in scenes with two Oscar winners.This is a must-see movie for anyone wanting to see more quality films and less action-packed/violence ridden/computer enhanced drivel at the theaters. Bravo!"", ""When I read Water for Elephants the book, I knew the film would be difficult to make and I was ready to be disappointed. Surprisingly, they managed to capture most of it in picture. Some things were lost on the way, of course, the most unfortunate one being old Jacob's struggles as an old man who refuses to retire from life before his time actually comes. Other details that made the book a masterpiece seemed more suitable for a book so they were not missed, mainly because the core story was there to its finest details.The reenactment of America in Great Depression was good, and the circus was everything you would expect it to be. Such chaos and life and acts and performers and runes and animals all mashed up in a beautiful lively atmosphere. Scenes flowed one after the other smoothly and nothing seemed out of place. This is a hard thing to accomplish when it comes to adaptations. Most of them end up looking like a slide show of pictures or events taken from the book (see Hardwicke's Twilight for a perfect example). This film was a success.The acting was another noteworthy aspect. People will have to acknowledge Robert Pattinson as a first class actor after watching this; and Waltz will be the go-to person for the upcoming psycho roles. He just digs it, I think and he creates the most intimidating gentleman on screen. Witherspoon looked average to me as Marlena, but I may be biased so I won't go into it much. All in all, it would be bizarre if at least one out of the three did not get an Oscar nod."", ""i loved the book & i loved the movie, & will go see it a few more times, taking many friends with me. YES, it's that good!!! When one goes to the movie made from the book one loves, it's always with a bit of trepidation, knowing how things can turn out. KUDOS to Richard LaGravenese for writing an excellent screenplay from Sara Gruen's excellent novel! We were pleasantly surprised how well they included all of the most important points of Depression Era Circus life (and the story line), and happy that it was PG-13, and not the R of the book (which means we can take a larger variety of folks to the movie.) Each of the actors was excellent, capturing the true feeling of the characters in the book.Loved the animals, tho we missed the Yak at the end of the story..... and Tai was a FABULOUS Rosie!!! i am POSITIVE that the reviewers who have been giving this excellent movie bad reviews have NOT read the book in it's entirety, or are just Bah-Humbugs when it comes to giving a terrific movie a look-see with OPEN EYES. i was so very anxious to see it for myself so i would know the TRUTH about the movie!!! Anyone who has read and loved the book will love this movie. Anyone who has been to a circus, or knows the history of the circus life over the generations, will greatly appreciate Water For Elephants.WELL DONE, ALL of the cast and crew!!!!!!"", 'I was enchanted by this film. The feel, the music, the costumes. Truly a beautiful film. Story line was not complicated, things did not explode. It was a wonderfully woven story of love, loyalties, finding second chances and a little history thrown in for good measure.The story was enriched in the details and it was a lovely way to be transported for two hours and feel so many emotions all at once. I love animals so this film touched my heart. August was both charming and terrifying. Brilliant. Marlena a woman torn between a life where she finally had a family, though imperfect, and a second chance! Jacob was the eyes and ears that we saw this whole story from. I felt his every emotion and lived it with him.The secondary characters and animals were so rich and interesting.WELL DONE!!']",18,"['Drama', 'Romance']"

The film offers no opportunity to connect with the characters, which is a shame considering it\'s based on a true story. The comedy feels forced, but with more work on some of the gags and general tightening of the editing and pacing, some of it would have come across better.

Of course a distraction occurs and the proposal doesn't happen. Poor Quinn has other girls lusting for him. Poor Quinn can't say no. This is most of the movie. Quinn chasing Devon, girls chasing Quinn, and it gets boring.I think Helberg over did the simple plot and character because at a couple of points I was ready to quit the movie. On the plus side there actually is some very nice dialog between characters in a few scenes.If you want a silly boy gets girl, boy looses girl, boy gets girl story this might fill your need."", ""This is not ranking high on comedy actually, it is mostly just passing time with a couple of good scenes here and there, but overall it is not that funny. I think the best parts are subtle ones, with small funny statements, or incidents and not the typical hurt yourself or crash into something that this has most of.Simon Helberg has some way to go, but it is a good attempt it is just not as funny as I had expected from him. His part is really good, he is very insecure and messes up a lot of stuff, he plays his role very well. His farther played by Alfred Molina is also a good character. But I don't think the rest contribute much to the great parts of this movie unfortunately."", ""-We'll Never Have Paris is a limited release film about a loser who, after dating a girl for 10 years, decides to finally propose. He then is almost unintentionally drawn into two different relationships, causing his girl to run away for Paris and hi to go after her and beg her forgiveness.-I saw it because Zachary Quinto was in it. Really that is the only reason. What I got was not a terrible movie, but it not that good.-The story would be cliché, cheesy, predictable, and over-the-top rom-com. However it is actually based on a true story, which is one of the best things the film has going for it.-The pace was not great, but I did not find it slow, just uneven.-The acting was a balance between good and bad. So yeah. It stars the guy who plays Howard Walawitz, and he did a fine job. The girl did a fine job. The daughter from taken did a fine job. And Zachary Quinto did a fine job. But nobody was more than just fine.-The characters are interesting to watch and entertainingly inconsistent, but most of the supporting characters don't seem to serve much of a purpose. Another problem with them is that you don't like any of them.-The music was interesting. Most of it was French, but they only spent the last 1/3rd of the film in France, so it did not seem to really fit that much.-So one of the worst things about the film is that it I a comedy, but I only laughed once in the entire film. It is also a 'romantic' movie, with only one romantic moment. So it really did not succeed at what it was trying to be.-Also, We'll Never Have Paris is rated-R and would have been the same or better if it were PG-13. It has some language in it, but not consistently harsh. It also has a strong PG-13 amount of sexual content.-So We'll Never Have Paris has a few small elements, like a good finale, that are entertaining, but it really did not succeed as a comedy or a romantic movie. Combine that with characters you don't really like and you get a film you have no attachment to. I'm going to say that We'll Never Have Paris really just isn't worth the time."", ""Loving his from the Big Bang Theory, I went to watch this movie with Simon Helberg. I have to say that I was surprised by the IMDb rating at the beginning, and once the movie was over, I could not explain why it is so low. If I had the option I would give it a 6.5. I loved this movie cause it was a real story. It was funny at times and the only thing I could say about that is that I would expect it to be even more funnier given the fact that Simon is a really really comic figure. I did not care for the guy playing his friend at all. His fiancée in the movie performed brilliantly as all the other members of the cast. On the downside again, it was kind of a slow movie and could have used some more action, or a quicker progression of everything. The one thing I really loved though, and it's the only reason why I would suggest the movie, is the depiction of the character by Helberg. He is not the macho kind of the lover and the usual love story where everything happens as expected. He depicts a loving guy that also messes things up big time and a lot. He makes mistakes and once he tries to correct them, it does not work out for the best every time. For all these reasons, this is a really down-to-earth movie and realistic that I would definitely watch."", ""It's not a bad movie nor a great one. Though it's a common plot, it has it's own uniqueness. I'm not totally OK with the casting though. But the music and the flow kept be bounded throughout."", 'I think it\'s fair to say that most of us have known a Quinn-type character; excessively nervous, inclined to exhibit OCD tendencies, intelligent but inarticulate, lovable but not obviously attractive. Helberg couldn\'t be other than he acts himself, could he? His character is played out perfectly and hilariously. If only the same could be said for the other characters, most of which hardly got off the starting blocks. Major opportunities were missed to explore the supporting characters and their motives; maybe other movies will follow to redress this omission? Favourite moment has to be when Quinn realises that his dream ""model"" girl isn\'t at all compatible with him and his reaction to those deal-breaking traits. A funny, watchable movie which was exactly the length it needed to be. I would like to see a sequel which told us what happened next to Quinn and perhaps also what happened next to the other main characters, Devon, Kelsey, Jameson, Kurt and Terry (or maybe a retrospective for him).', ""I don't believe in the low rates people gave to this film. It is an cute romantic comedy, but apparently people like nonsense like Nicholas Sparks and 50 shades of Gray :( Both actors are believable and endearing. the whole story could happen to anyone deeply in love and this is what makes the film so adorable. I really enjoy watching it.Oh, and the soundtrack is great too and there are great shots of Paris. Simon Helberg has a great comic timing (we know that from TBBT!) and Melanie Lynskey is one of my favourite actress.It's really funny to think that this is a fictional version of something that really happened to Simon and his wife."", ""This helped me pass the time on a lazy afternoon. I actually was impressed by Simon Helberg's effort in this one. Melanie Lynskey was her usual charming self too. It was a pleasant, slightly funny tale.\nOne critic pointed out that it was not that funny of a comedy, but as a rom-com, it really wasn't supposed to be hilarious. I usually can come close when guessing the IMDb rating of a movie and I guessed this one at about 6 and was surprised at the below 5 star rating. As far as low-key rom-coms go, this wasn't that bad,"", 'I am perplexed at the low IMDb score. So I have offered to spend a few minutes in a bid to rectify this wrong! Simon Helberg is good in the role. Few of the other actors fall short. The script could have been better developed. It is actually quite alright. Melanie Lynskey is also quite all right, even though the viewer is initially not made to connect with her character much. It sorts itself out later in the film. This does not have the Big Bang Theory sort of comedy. It is a much darker sort of comedy British viewers will enjoy more.This film is not tedious like many Woody Allen copy cats. It is should have had an average score of 6 on IMDb.']",11,"['Comedy', 'Romance']"

But it is also hilarious, with many funny situations. The great cast shows a fantastic chemistry and seems to have fun while making the movie, and is supported by a delicious screenplay and an excellent music score. My advice is simple: shut-down your brain and laugh with this highly recommended comedy. See also their one hundred and fifty-five (155) Rules of Wedding Crashing in IMDb. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Penetras Bom de Bico"" (""Crashers Good of Talking"")', 'The Frat-Pack, are surely the hardest working collective in Hollywood. Hardly a month goes by without a movie featuring Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jack Black, Will Ferrell, or those Wilson boys Luke and Owen being released.When Starsky and Hutch paired Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller it was good, when Dodgeball put Vince Vaughn with Ben Stiller it was better, but ""Wedding Crashers"" could well be the finest Frat-Pack pairing to date.Although Wilson and Vaughn have appeared in four movies together so far, this is the first where they\'ve both taken star billing. In ""Wedding Crashers"", John Beckwith (Wilson) and Jeremy Klein (Vaughn), are a pair of divorce mediators whose passion in life is sneaking into weddings to take advantage of the free food.. and of course score with girls.They have a strict \'crashers rulebook\', which dictates the etiquette of the pick-up, such as \'never use your real name\'. It also suggests, by behaving raucously, loudly and generally being the life-and-soul, people will think you\'re so obnoxious, you can\'t not have been invited.The pair eventually find themselves at odds with each other when John meets and falls for a bridesmaid at the Washington society wedding of the year.Although ""Wedding Crashers"" is at times formulaic, the comic performances raise this movie above par and in lesser hands the main characters could have descended into Rom-Com cliché. The fast-talking machine-gun delivery of Vaughn is the perfect accompaniment to Wilson\'s laconic style. Their single-guy banter\'s often painfully accurate, as is the acknowledgement they\'re both a little too old to be acting so carelessly. There are also some great comic set-pieces too, notably the divorce meeting, the weddings montage, the cringe-worthy football game and the hunting trip.The supporting cast are also an asset, Christopher Walken expertly walks the tightrope of being both broodingly intimidating and likable, while Rachel McAdams\' \'Claire\' has a charming vulnerability and an easy-to-fall-in love with quality. Former ""Home and Away"" pin-up Isla Fisher however, is less convincing.I admit ""Wedding Crashers"" is far from perfect, at time situations seem too contrived, the nudity is laughably gratuitous, and Claire\'s evil fiancée Sack (Bradley Cooper) is an almost too heavy-handed device to make Wilson look good.But if you can look past all that, and simply accept it for what it is, you\'re left with a very funny film. 8/10', 'Movie lives through Vaughn and Wilson. Both show an easy performance and want the audience to just simply have a good time.The Story is nothing spectacular. If you liked ""Meet the Fockers"", you\'re gonna like this one as well.Its the actors, who make the difference. Vaughn is hilarious and proofs, that he\'s much better in comedies than in ""serious"" movies. Wilson plays himself (as in every one of his movies) and scores a good 2nd place.Walken is just Walken and thats worth half the ticket. The girls are gorgeous. Especially Rachel McAdams knocked me out. Holy Cow! The Crashers are good fun. Not an new invention of the genre, but especially because of the actors, this movie rocks!', ""This movie will never win an Oscar, but it still surprised me and became my favorite summer movie this year. The plot, as in all good summer comedies, is simple. Two guys who crash weddings to pick up woman have zany adventures and learn a little something along the way. The real fun of this movie is in the actors, who deliver their performances perfectly. Owen Wilson is the aging California surfer type who may be ready to move on with his life. Vince Vaughn is his best friend who frequently acts like a spoiled, horny child but is actually a good guy. Christopher Walken is the slightly scary father of the love interest. So if you have seen Wilson in Shanghai Noon and Vaughn in Swingers and Walken in, well almost anything he has ever made, then you have seen these characters before. But still, they just work well together here. The movie contains just enough real emotion to keep you caring and enough absurdity and broad physical comedy to keep you laughing. This isn't Shakespeare, but it is funny. Highly recommend."", 'I was lucky enough to see a sneak peak of this at New Line Cinema about 4 months ago, and it was very very funny. It starts off a little slow, with Vince Vaughn carrying the film based on the fact that almost anything he does is funny... but then the film really finds itself a little bit later and the laughs begin. The further the movie goes the funnier it gets. And it honestly looks like something we all can do and have a blast doing it. I recommend this to others and I plan on actually plan on seeing it again when it comes out... Although this time I have to pay for it.go see wedding crashers', ""John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) are life-long friends who have made a hobby out of lying to get into wedding receptions, where they pick up vulnerable women with even more lies.

Wedding Crashers is easily the funniest film of 2005. It's constantly hilarious and it's not completely immature. The premise is pretty creative and original. The film is not just filled with cheap jokes and toilet humor. There's actually a pretty mature love story to be found here as well. In all honestly, the script isn't that great but the film works really well because of the cast. The actors bring life into their characters and most of them give funny performances. Vince Vaughn is the true star of Wedding Crashers. His over the top performance is very funny. Some people may find him annoying though. Owen Wilson also gives a funny performance. He just wasn't as good as Vince but he holds his own. Together, Vaughn and Wilson have great chemistry and really make their scenes with one another really funny.Rachel McAdams is one of the best young actresses working today. She appeared in three movies in 2005 and this one was the best. Her performance is pretty good and it's so easy to love this girl. Christopher Walken does his usual routine and he gives an okay performance. He isn't as funny as everyone else though. Isla Fisher is also another talented young actress. She comes out of no where and gives a very funny performance. Jane Seymour is underused which is too bad because she's pretty funny. Bradley Cooper was okay, nothing really special though. Not all of the film is perfect. I think the running time is too long. Long comedies rarely work out and while this one does, it could have still been edited. Also, the ending is kind of cheesy which is okay but a little unexpected. Will Ferrell makes a cameo and let's just say that it was not needed. It wasn't completely bad but he seemed to be trying way too hard. I really think that he's just an average comedian and nothing really special. One last thing, the film is pretty funny yet it doesn't have that great of a repeat value, at least for me. In the end, Wedding Crashers is worth checking out. Rating 8/10"", 'An excellent comedy, Vince Vaughn is a gifted comedian. He kept ""Old School"" going, was the only light in a dismal ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", and had a terrific debut lead in ""Swingers"". I highly recommend people considering this movie, to watch the extras on the DVD; there is a karaoke scene at an Asian wedding which will have you rolling. It is a shame it was cut from the movie, but as the director\'s comments stated, ""They just couldn\'t find a place where it would fit."" I was very pleasantly surprised at the number of times I laughed out loud, a rarity for me while watching comedies. The lines were witty, the delivery was crisp, and the jokes were mostly new and fresh. Rachel McAdams was stunning, an excellent casting choice to play the object of Owen Wilson\'s desire. Despite the more or less rehashed plot (two guys lie about themselves to meet women, only to find that they now have a dilemma when they find 2 they really like), the film is nonetheless novel and original. There are a number of obviously stereotypical characters, (drunken grandmother, artistic introverted son, psychotic cheating boyfriend, immoral mother, powerful father), but they work in this film. Particularly the grandmother, who is prone to drunken scatological exclamations, had me laughing my head off. It was quite unexpected.Although many of the situations could come off as contrived, they were secondary to the excellent repartee between Wilson and Vaughn. Their comic pairing worked to a T.R.', ""Saw a advance screening of this on Friday night. Hilarious doesn't do the film justice. You know how in most films you remember the funniest parts and bring them up as you leave the theater? This one, it's hard to remember the best parts because there's so many of them.Unlike his previous films, where Vince Vaughn is usually reduced to the role of 'scene stealer', here we get a full dose of Babaganush, and he's in his finest form since 'Swingers'. If you liked him in his Swingers/Made persona, you'll love him here. Some of the riffs that he has literally will have you holding your sides with laughter.Owen Wilson is Owen Wilson. You either like him or you don't. He's more of the straight man in this film, although he does have some pretty good lines too, and he has great chemistry with Vaughn, especially in the scenes where they're fighting. He's the ying to Vaughn's yang.The movie certainly 'earns' it's R rating. There's a healthy dose of nudity, sex related hijinks, and f-bombs. But it's not 'gross out' humor a la American Pie. It pushes boundaries, but not just in a 'shock value' way. It's genuinely funny.I saw the movie with a bunch of critics, who usually the jaded type, were laughing their asses of as well. Guys will love this movie and will be quoting it for the rest of the year. Girls will love it too though, and there is a romantic subplot (cheesy at times, but forgivable given how funny the movie is), with Rachael McAdams doing a great job as Owen Wilson's love interest. Isla Fischer plays the role of 'scene stealer' in this one, serving as Vince Vaughn's psycho love interest. And Chris Walken is Chris Walken.So overall..inappropriate, hilarious and glorious. Better than Oldschool. Way better than Anchorman. Best comedy of the year, maybe the last couple of years."", 'I will not bother with a synopsis, but I just saw a sneak preview of this movie tonight and had to write how much I loved it.Being a huge fan of both Vince Vaughn and Rachel McAdams might make me more partial to have chosen to see it originally, but it was both sweet and laugh out loud hilarious. In the vein of Old School, Anchorman & Starsky & Hutch, only with romance and quirky families thrown in to the mix. I think the audience for Wedding Crashers has the potential to be broader for that very reason. Vaughn and Wilson have a chemistry as lifelong friends, as do Wilson and McAdams as love interests. Supporting character roles were well cast and provided great framework.See it on the 15th!']",9,"['Comedy', 'Romance']"

Such a smart-ass, such a cool guy that he makes me lough through my tears. I would just smack him in the most of situations from the show if it happened in real life', ""I tried. I really really tried to give this show a shot. I heard good things about it and was ready to take the journey but I just can't go on any further. I was expecting something like Californication or Orange is the New Black but it's not even close. The storyline is sub par and the acting is worse. What they tried to do was make a heartfelt yet comedic story about a widowed mother of 2 who struggles day to day and has to rely on selling drugs to make ends meet. It failed miserably in my opinion. Mary-Louise Parker is so not believable in this role. I feel as the story continues it shows how poorly written her character is. She goes from a weak-willed pot dealer who can't control her children and has no friends except for the people she buys her drugs from and her accountant to an even less willed pot dealer who can't control her kids. No plot points. No story arch. Just a half hour of nonsense every episode with not one snicker or chuckle. I struggled through 3 seasons and had to stop. I honestly can't believe I made it that far. I'm really not sure what genre they were writing for here. It's not dramatic, it's not a comedy, it's definitely not suspenseful, it's not slapstick... The only thing remotely funny about this show is the character development.... And what I mean by that is there is NONE! There are MUCH better shows out there to spend time on. I for one do not care how this story ends. I am just very surprised so many people love it. The only reason it gets a 2 is because of Kevin Nealon. Without him I would've given it a 1."", 'Weeds is one of the more overrated TV shows I\'ve bothered to watch. It seemed to be the next ""It"" show, like Sopranos, Six Feet Under and Dexter. MLP got a golden globe for her part. But when you really analyze this show there isn\'t much there.Direction? A lot of cheap amateurish scene-cuts and jumps. Plot? Multiple situations where you expect the story to go somewhere and they just come up with a facile easy solution to end it. U-Turn? Peter? Just remove them from the story completely and go on to the next contrived situation.The characters are simplistic and there is little to explain why they behave as they do. The underlying morality that makes an audience like a character is absent (except for the case of Conrad who did seem to have a conscience and feelings). Everyone just seems to act on the spur of the plot twist. Furthermore, this show is probably the most racist show I have ever watched. Every ethnic group (including Suburban Whites) is reduced to the the most appalling insulting lowest common denominator. We\'ve get Step\'N\'Fetch It blacks, ornery border-line- psychotic Hispanics, Evil Hypocritical Christians, Shallow Good for nothing Surban Whites; they even play Sitar music when they show an Indian Family. The missing stereotype from it all is that of the anti-Christian-middle-America republican-hating Jews that write this garbage.Most of the acting is passable but, to be honest, MLP\'s cross-legged off-balance posing, while sucking on a latte through a straw and making goo-goo eyes at whatever male is supposed to melt in front of her gets old, as she tosses off smarmy not so clever barbs and comebacks. Really one dimensional when you get down to it. Ya..it\'s the cool show about the Drug dealing MILF. But, really, it ain\'t that cool, it\'s just a decent concept brought down by clichéd characters and stupid deus-ex-machina plot contrivances as needed.', ""This show is mildly interesting, watchable, but hardly something with an edge or a masterpiece, a few months ago the president of showtime complained how the show didn't get any controversy, because they love controversy, it seems like the show is trying too hard with scenes and subplots to get it, instead of pointing a different and unpopular view which is what usually causes the controversy.A few of the latest, pre-teens going lesbian, prepubescent boy receiving Asian handjob and the endless Bush's family remarks, f-cking his wife and dick in his daughter's mouth, this show looks more and more like a pathetic fat and hairy guy dancing naked in the middle of the street trying to get attention, it's just sad really, hardly something to be offended.I usually enjoy shows with no censorship and edge, this one however suffers from bad writings, it has decent characters, Mary-Louise Parker's Nancy used to be good, now it's just annoying, the rest of the cast shines in their parts, specially Kevin Nealon as Doug."", ""Let's face it....you take away the weed, and this shows just another forgettable sit-com. Teenage enuit....upper middle class parent pathos. Old, tired suburban melodrama that's supposedly lent some gravitas by dumping a little kind bud into the brownie mix. It took at total of fifteen minutes to peg each of the characters...a bad sign for most shows of this genre...an auspice of tedious repetition that can only drone on from episode to episode.So, load a bowl if you must, and try to wring a few chuckles from this torpid yawn. I found it, like most avid pot smokers I've known, an insufferable bore."", 'Weeds has always been full of hyperbole and social commentary via satire. It wasn\'t always all that insightful but it was clever and cute at the least. Unfortunately it\'s disdain, detachment from reality and holier than thou attitude often show through the wit. From it\'s grindingly unaware and sanctimonious title song, to it\'s hypocrite self centered characters...once the cute wears off, it\'s hard to give a crap about anything deeper because the surface is so tarnished.The ridiculous story lines not only do nothing for the point trying to be made, the absurd unbelievable plots treat the viewer like an idiot :Don\'t like anti-drug laws....so the proponent of said laws is a barely functioning alcoholic whose entire life is a train wreck. How clever. Alcohol is worse than Marijuana...we get it.The ""War on Terror"" sucks.... so the army randomly kills recruits with drone planes apparently driven by Gomer Pyle. To cover up they send in evil teams of black Ops LAWYERS to strong arm witnesses with magic toys that make the most ludicrous James Bond toy look like a calculator watch. I wish I was kidding. If I had to be fair, this is the scene that broke weeds for me. I forgave it\'s heavy handed idiocy and overlooked it\'s characters flaws and unrealistic reactions because to be honest...it was funny a lot of the time. I think I would have been much happier to watch them just flat out say ""The war on terror is ridiculous, and we have lost respect and trust for the Armed Forces."" Thats totally fine...I agree 110%. But a scene that makes Get Smart look realistic and hides behind weak attempts at humor? Cmon...what a joke.To top it off, the writers are often too afraid to make the protagonists react in realistic ways for fear of alienating weak minded viewers. Nancy can yell at her bumbling drug addict brother in law, but when her self centered prick of a son nearly gets her killed and essentially forces her into servitude with the local drug dealer by stealing her drugs...she never mentions it. In fact no one even addresses it.I want to like the show. Heck a lot of times I do. Mary Lousie Parker is droll and kissably cute...not to mention incredibly versatile in her role. The soundtrack is often pointed and sharp, which is in stark contrast to the ham fisted finger wagging of the actual show. Sadly, 9 times out of 10, I share Weeds outlook on the topics they address. However, the childish and unrealistic way they address them often makes me wish I didn\'t for fear of association with halfwits.In the end it\'s just hard to tolerate preaching from a show so flawed.', 'For years Weeds is being the ""everybody-talks-about"" series but I never had the opportunity to watch it. But finally I did it, and I did it desperately because the show is addictive. So finally I could understand why it got so much attention.First of all, the cast is amazing. Mary-Luise Parker, as Nancy Botwin, fits so well in her character and she is so charismatic and so beautiful and so subtle, gentle, comprehensive and polite that it\'s almost impossible dislike her. Elizabeth Perkins, as Celia Hodes, my god, that woman rocks! She\'s so naturally dried by the unhappy life she has built that even a spontaneous smile seems like a rock. I can\'t believe that Elizabeth Perkins never won an award for this character until now because every moment is an outstanding performance and I mean it! It\'s a shame that her character lost so much of her potentials to a point of being kicked out of the show because Celia was one of the gears of the show.The most interesting things about the show were not the drugs, neither was Nancy living a hell each new day, nor the mistakes each character does during the episodes, but yes the social matters that it pointed. I\'m Brazilian and I live in a small suburban city like the imaginary Agrestic/Magestic, so... I know a lot how is to survive in a place where you\'re surrounded by ignorant people that are moved just by an inexistent appearance. It\'s so revolting to a point that sometimes you just want to do things just to provoke them and play with their abstraction of reality, and the series shows it in a very intelligent and interesting way so you feel connected by it.But now, after 6 years and some changes, Weeds seems to have lost most of what made it so interesting during the years becoming just another dramedy and Weeds is now just all about a woman dealing with an everyday drama that doesn\'t fit anymore. While the first 4 seasons were amazing and subtle in its subject, the last 2 seasons lack of the cleverness that once existed. Weeds now is being pushed to something we don\'t know anymore and it\'s showing signs of tiredness and completely losing its identity and also its characters. But that happens with every kind of show sooner or later.But anyway... if you have the opportunity to watch at least the first 4 seasons, do it. Weeds is not about dealing with drugs, but a way to express the hypocrisy of each single person in the world.I give 8 just for the show in a whole, but the first 4 seasons deserve 10.', ""Weeds is a hilarious comedy, following other trend-setting shows like The Sopranos and Six Feet Under that deal with real life issues (using real life language). Sometimes wonderfully dark, and sometimes very blunt, the humour seems to suit each episode's general mood.The quickly progressing story lines provide plenty of interest and we quickly develop a sympathy for the main characters through some genuinely emotional dilemmas, especially Nancy, but this is no doubt helped by the fact that she is a gorgeous soccer mum in distress.The small number of episodes in each series might be a little disappointing, but is easily forgiven in helping to maintain the high quality and originality of each episode. I can't wait for season 2.""]",10,['Drama']
Weird Science,3.56,3.94,"['Comedy', 'Romance', 'Fantasy']","Two high-school nerds use a computer program to literally create the perfect woman, who promptly turns their lives upside-down.",disgust,"['The most fiendish trick of John Hughes\' filmography is the manner in which he takes patent untruths about society\'s outcasts (usually within the realm of high school, his preferred battleground) and weaves them into something that successfully deceives the viewer into thinking otherwise. I\'m not complaining, since his commitment to character usually overrides all else, making even the most contrived leaps of faith engaging. Unfortunately, his commitment to character takes a turn for the disastrous in ""Weird Science,"" easily his worst film. Two shrill, unlikeable high-school losers, frustrated over their inability to score with chicks, decide to create one of their own (through some laughably awful 1985 computer technology), in the form of vacant Playboy centerfold Kelly LeBrock. But hey: these shrill, unlikeable losers (who would be justifiably subjected to beatings by their own nerdy peers) really just need to face the fact that a little confidence is all it takes to impress the ladies (and stand up to your sadistic, Army-brat brother)! I have come to expect the contrived, 20-minute opening setup that frames the remainder of a Hughes film, but the setup for ""Weird Science"" is non-existent; in its place is a gimmick: a glut of special effects and out-of-place action (in the third act, a bunch of bikers out of ""Mad Max"" terrorize our hapless losers) that tears any possible humanity to shreds. It\'s not spoiling anything to say that the losers get with their respective hotties in the end (and are much more worldly, sensitive guys than the horndogs we first met), but the manner by which Hughes arrives at this conclusion rings so patently false it\'s infuriating.', ""Lonely teenagers Wyatt (Mitchell-Smith) and Gary (Hall) decide to make a woman that fits all their requirements from a computer, only to find not everything fits perfectly.There were two words that attracted me to this high school comedy, John and Hughes. The mastermind behind the conceptual excellence of skiving school to live in Ferris Bueller's day off to the film that showcased how teenagers really felt about their suffocating parents in the Breakfast club, the man seemed to have his knowledge spot on regarding teenage life.What emerges is a pretty standard and very degrading depiction of lonely lust, containing two teenagers who are the good guys, but are hard pushed to maintain that.Anthony Michael Hall, a hero from the Breakfast Club, feels repetitive and loud in another role for Hughes. Mitchell-Smith likewise feels weak and a stereotype of high school repression and against Hall, we have the most conventional and boring comedy duo ever mastered, which is a great shame for a director and writer who also created some of the best teenage comedy ever.The premise for the story sounds promising, two lads attempt to break science through some technological mastery in an attempt to fulfil their lust on a weekend away from their parents.So after some degrading and embarrassing perversion by the lead duo on cheerleaders and a head turner away from dropped pants do the duo retreat to their sanctuary and form an hyperbole of illogical science to fulfil their uses and gratifications. Through some fast flowing wires and a bemused science guard to the pair get their just deserts.One thing John Hughes usually does perfectly is introductions and Kelly LeBrock's opening shot is the equivalent of Megan Fox in Transformers, a slow panning from her legs upwards in a small Barbie styled costume, a beautiful introduction which is maintained through the nest few scenes as she jumps into the shower with the two lads, uses provocative gestures such as late drinking and kissing practice to keep any horny male teenager hooked.Certainly LeBrock hits the nail on the head, acting flirtatious and forward to justify her character as perfect female, until the inevitable outcome the plot always has in mind, there is more to a person than looks tag.Through some careful shots and repetitive music we see the story pan out as any other romantic comedy would and there are minimal surprises to generate a good watch, particularly when the humour is gross out and shamefully degrading to the actors.The final nail in the coffin is the change in personalities of the final act and as predictable as the coming of next year will have you shaking your head.Certainly not too much consequence came from this film as there were Ferris Bueller's amongst others to follow and create a reputation of teenage comedy mastery."", ""I find it unbelievable that John Hughes, director of comedy classics like Ferris Bueller and The Breakfast Club, actually wrote and directed this piece of junk. There is no justification for this movie; the humor is painfully weak (minus a few scenes namely involving Kelly LeBrock) and the acting terrible, while only at about 1h 20min it felt about half an hour too long. All the crashing, yelling and screaming grew so tedious by the end that I was left wondering why I didn't flick it off half way through. I guess I was expecting something genuinely funny or interesting to happen. I don't think it should matter that I saw this movie 21 years after it came out, because The Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller's Day Off were superb films made within a year of Weird Science. I'm sorry to say this about a Hughes film (obviously set in Chicago, Shermer High School), but avoid this movie at all costs."", ""The teen movie genre of the 1980s had as its central premise 'finding a partner'. So this movie is no exception but where it differs is its bizarre way of hammering home the obvious messages this film contains.\nThe plot for those who aren't aware concerns two 'nerds' who decide to create a woman using their computer(!).  As a young teen myself watching this for the first time I never really considered how totally out there this John Hughes film is.  Apart from the idea of creating a perfect woman who does everything you want (a horrendously sexist idea that is hardly redeemed by the weak moralising at the end), we have snow falling in someones' bedroom, a kitchen turned blue, nuclear warheads sprouting through a bedroom floor and furniture flying through chimneys.  The one part of this film that really strikes me as odd is where did Kelly Le Brock (who plays Lisa the created woman) get her powers to make all this weird stuff happen?I was pretty disappointed when I revisited this.  Nostalgia had created this movie as a minor classic in my rose tinted eyes. In reality all I found was a plot full of holes, an unpleasant teen fantasy and a director who looked like he couldn't give a damn about any more 'nerdy teens come good'."", ""Every high school boy's dream comes true in this wayward film about a couple of guys creating the ultimate woman. Cool, confined and well acted (considering the bad cast), this film really captures some of the follies of 1980s youth. The materialism, the shallowness and the lack of parental control really demonstrates what kids back then really wanted. While I was not a teenager at this time, it was still a fun movie to watch, one that kept me interested the entire time I watched it."", 'Even when John Hughes makes a mediocre film such as ""Weird Science,"" the nature of his intent still shines through, to the point where you can\'t necessarily fault him for anything except not making a better one. ""Weird Science"" serves as the ultimate 1980s high school nerd fantasy, one in which babes see social awkwardness as a turn-on and bullies and extortionist older brothers help themselves to large servings of humble pie. The movie truly doesn\'t need to be anything more, even in spite of the shallowness of its characters and general disregard for logic.Anthony Michael Hall (in his fourth Hughes film in three years) and Ilan Mitchell-Smith star as two losers who determine that if they can\'t get girls the ""old-fashioned"" way that they can use their computer smarts to play Frankenstein and create the ideal woman. After some illegal hacking they pack her with a high IQ (and an appropriate breast size) then hook a doll up to a machine. One crazy storm inside their house later and suddenly there\'s Lisa (Kelly LeBrock), who\'s every bit as stunning with a type A personality as a nerd could possibly imagine or desire.The story then goes the unexpected route. Lisa, equipped with mad street smarts and magic powers, literally takes over the driver\'s seat and the young Gary and Wyatt for a wild ride. After helping them loosen up a bit, she determines they need a few tests to find the courage they need to stand up to bullies and go after the girl.Hughes determines that Lisa needs no rhyme or reason other than causing an appropriate amount of mischief so the boys can learn a valuable thing or two. She\'s the fairy godmother of this fantasy; it\'s one thing to stand up to your parents, for example, and tell them you\'re going to a party, and it\'s another to have a hot model do it for you (and cause your father to forget who you are). Hughes basically sticks it to everyone who made his life crappy during his teens, though to be fair, he recognizes the nerd\'s shortcomings and doesn\'t paint them as heroes. Hughes has always played things close to the chest, filming most of his movies in the Chicago suburbs where he grew up, even naming the high school in ""Weird Science"" after the main road where his actual high school was. In this film he has absolute loony fun with his usual tropes, going as far as turning Bill Paxton, who plays Wyatt\'s militaristic older brother Chet, into a steaming pile of crap that looks like Jabba the Hut.Fans of the more romantic side of Hughes, who love his candid nature toward portraying high schoolers, might find ""Weird Science"" to be the wild mutt of the family with its irreverence, and high level of silliness. It could be considered the ""cult favorite"" of the Hughes collection and that\'s fine. It definitely caters to those who can relate to being a socially outcast teenage boy and not too many others, but by no means is it a slip-up for the coming-of-age master. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com', '80s! I\'m living in the 80s! If you love 80s teen movies, then Weird Science ought to be in your catalogue. It is one of director John Hughes most memorable, and one of the 80s most original.Written in two days, this is a teen science fiction film, the story of two teenage loners, Wyatt (the always grimacing Ilan-Mitchell Smith) and Gary (Anthony Michael Hall before he went deadpan) and their weird way of discovering girls. A variation on Frankenstein, the teenagers create a beautiful woman (the super cool Kelly LeBrock) using their computer and some clever hacking skills (of course, it\'s exaggerated). Their creation is Lisa, the chic English accent woman who brings a little life to the subtle Illinois suburb. As the antithesis of both Wyatt and Gary\'s personalities, she\'s going to show these boys a little adventure, get them to loosen up, and for crying out loud, gain some self-esteem.Because Lisa is a lady with some supernatural power like freezing grandparents in time, erasing the memory of a bad first impression with Gary\'s parents, turning Wyatt\'s obnoxious military school brother Chet (Bill Paxton in his funniest, most arrogant role yet) into a giant pus maggot, or even having a gang of mutant bikers storming a house party. And Lisa\'s greatest gift to the boys: showing them true love by helping them along to meet the two girls they\'ve been after all along, their high school classmates, Deb and Hilly, who are unfortunately hung up on the dweeb bullies, Max (Robert Russler) and Ian (Robert Downey, Jr.). So essentially, it deals with many aspects of teen angst (but more like just teen self-esteem or self-consciousness issues) within one story. Parents, class status (done subtly here as opposed to Some Kind of Wonderful or Pretty in Pink), relationships, etc. It works well, and is done quite humorously.One of my favorite scenes is when the trio (Lisa, Gary, and Wyatt) go to the night club looking pretty out of place (they\'re not only the only white people there, but probably the only ones under thirty). Once Anthony Michael Hall\'s character, Gary, gets drunk and starts with his slang, it\'s hilarious. Reminds me a little of Adventures in Babysitting when the gang drops in on the club and they\'re not allowed to leave until they sing. So eventually, they loosen up and have a little fun.It\'s a wonderful movie with a classic John Hughes comic touch (says the mutant biker to Gary and Wyatt after they threaten to kill them if they don\'t leave, ""Please don\'t tell anyone about this. I\'d hate to lose my teaching job.). Plus, it\'s got a great soundtrack, featuring Killing Joke, Lords of the New Church, and Oingo Boingo doing the title song. The music video for it was fantastic, and not only features clips from the movie, but Kelly LeBrock herself in Oingo Boingo\'s own rendition of creating the woman via technology. Although not one of John Hughes\' best (I think Sixteen Candles is still his greatest), it is certainly one of his most memorable and one that I will love no matter how old I get. So have yourself a lazy Saturday, pop in the movie, and enjoy.', 'WEIRD SCIENCE was a great movie made in the mid 80s.The cast is pretty cool,it is fairly well acted,and its total fun! The film develops nicely from beginning nearly till the end,the last 15 minutes of the film are rather unnecessary.Although not the best 80s film out,it is a great imaginary film,with pretty cool SFX. Bill Paxton did an exceptionally well performance,i had total fun watching this movie,you will too!7.5 out of 10', ""Does a movie need definitive plot points or events that move the characters forward? No! Weird Science proves that a movie need be nothing more than a series of jokes and visual gags. But Weird Science is also a movie with a message. That message – horny boys and science is a wicked combination. Once you see John Hughes' masterpiece about Frankensex, you will be asking yourself why you ever quoted The Breakfast Club. I sense you doubting that Weird Science effectively taps into the troubled teen psyche with sincerity and insight. Well consider the following. A bodacious babe is front and center with Einstein's intellect and essence of David Lee Roth. A teenage girl is stripped naked by a vacuum cleaner chimney – which is okay cuz it's in the name of science. Bill Paxton is reduced to a Jim Hensonesque troll! A giant phallic missile penetrates a suburban house. Still not convinced? Well, just watch the last half hour. A gang of road ragers crashes the obligatory 80s teen party, do donuts all over the floors and smack random guys in the crotch. Bennet from Commando asks the heroes if they have tossed off to any good books lately and Anthony Michael Hall get's all Dirty Harry on their uninvited post- apocalypse asses. This is a work of unparalleled brilliance and sophistication. It's got Robert Downey Jr. in it too!"", 'I rented WEIRD SCIENCE almost three years ago. It was a five day rental, and I watched it like seven times! It was a movie thats fun to watch. You can watch it over and over aguin and it would still be fun. I think all teens and pre-teens should love this movie.', ""God bless the 80's, and may they live on way after their time!  This film captures the 80's geeks, preps, and class rivalry.  It was a hard time to fit in, but a fun time, like most teenagers, I had these fantasies that this movie reflects on.  I can not believe they got Wes from the Road Warrior to do a part.  The scene where the computer animated women talks to Michael Halls parent is hilarious, but sick.  The stuff going out of the chimney, the MX missile, and the kitchen turning blue is funny.  Bill Paxion or chet is a classic wait and see what happens to him.  Anyways rent it live it and be it! 8/10"", 'Actually maybe there never were! this woman is a creation of science and perfection!!\nI just wish there was a little more skin shown.\nThe scene with a rocket coming up through the floor is too funny.', ""Weird Science is the best 80's comedy that was ever made. I'm saying it. Ghostbusters, Summer Rental, The Great Outdoors, Strange Brew, Gung Ho, Mr. Mom, all of these movies have their place, but none of them can match Weird Science for laughs or pure....eightiesness. Yes eightiesness is a quality. It's a corny, dated quality but one that is tangible and valued by my fellow eighties loving brethren to this day. Come back with me if you will to a time when Anthony Michael Hall was still fielding calls and Kelly LeBrock was French for sexy.Weird Science has everything that an eighties comedy needs: A least one hot girl, a few actors who are no longer working or who do anything that will come along, plenty of dashing eighties threads, a corny as hell eighties soundtrack,(and Oingo Boingo is as corny and eighties as they get), and plenty of cheap funny jokes. Undoubtedly the best thing about Weird Science is Bill Paxton, who plays Wyatt's older brother Chet. Chet is the worst big brother ever to grace a movie screen and is a role model for all big brothers everywhere, me included. Chet delights in extorting money and valuables from Wyatt in exchange for his silence about Wyatt's activities. The best part in the movie is when Chet gets turned into the toad thing or whatever it is. Man I love that part. The rest of the cast does a good job of being their stock characters. Kelly LeBrock does a good job of being hot. Robert Downey Jr. shows none of the signs of future drug addiction. The film is unremarkable in the fact that it isn't anything groundbreaking or special. It's just a funny movie. And an eighties classic. Bottom Line: If you grew up in the eighties and you never saw Weird Science then you must atone for your crimes by going out and buying it right now. Then send me an email telling me how grateful you are that I put you on the path to rightousness and eighties correctness."", ""Weird Science is the product of the prolific '80s' writer/director John Hughes (who later went on to create films such as 'Home Alone'). This man single-handedly crafted movies about teenagers for teenagers, without ever becoming patronising or authoritative. Weird Science epitomises the 80s with its fast cars, shoulder pads and big hair. To be honest, Weird Science is synonymous with that decade and reflects most if not all, of its hopes and aspirations (computers in every home, robotic servants etc.). Looking back on it now it's incredibly dated, however and more importantly, the film is still as entertaining today as it was over ten years ago!Anyone who grew up in the 80s and is beginning to reminisce will instantly relate to the exploits of the two lead characters Gary (Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt (Ilan Mitchell-Smith), as they use their computer and associated paraphernalia to create a beautiful girlfriend (Kelly LeBrock). Although not Hughes' best work, this was reserved (in my opinion) for the later 'Ferris Beuller's Day Off' which was far more appealing to a wider audience - Weird Science will always be a 'Geeky' 80s classic. The film was so popular it spawned it's own TV series - ten years later!Unless you lived through that decade the film won't touch you in quite the same way. You needed to have been in awe of Tron, to have worn stone washed jeans and to have owned at least two pairs of illuminous [odd] socks, to really appreciate the naivety of the main characters as they place their faith in computers and 'modern' technology.Today to a younger - more clued up audience, Weird Science could get lost amongst so many other 80s flicks with inferior technology and  visual special FX to today's CGI standards. However there is something quintessentially 80s, something oh so Duran Duran about Weird Science that separates it from even the best of today's films. It's that central 'Hughes' element with its visual nuances and audible gags that makes this a timeless classic, watchable again and again.If you know what 'ghetto blaster' is definitely watch this film, if you were born after 1984 take everything with a pinch of salt and pay attention - you might learn something."", 'This is a story of 2 boys who create a super cool woman. The most funny thing is that these boys are total losers. They are oppressed by the society. Lisa - the cool fictional woman - teaches them how to become popular and brings out their best qualities.

One of the most important features of this movie is that it teaches people to be brave.I watched this movie as a child and i loved it. My opinion is that this should be a classic not just a mere comedy of the 80\'s. I hope all who watch the movie will be very satisfied with it :)', ""One of the best fantasy/sci-fi movies ever. Also a good 80's flick.  A lot of very funny jokes and laughs. Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith do a good job playing nerds and are hilarious.

I love the 80's."", ""For anyone who spent their pre/early teens in the late '80s, this film made a huge impact.  Its fantastical theme was still somewhat believable at that age, while the sexual energy was beginning to steam ahead full throttle. Another  triumph for the great John Hughes, and a high point for Anthony Michael Hall."", ""John Hughes does it again!This is his greatest film to date, especially if you were part of the 80's flair and style, and even more so if you have ever wanted to bring Kelly LeBrock into your bedroom!Watch Wyatt and Gary design their 'perfect' woman on Wyatt's Apple Lisa (hence the character name) and break into DataNet to make her super intelligent with a side effect of magical powers.

Any effort at all to shoot outdoor scenes outdoors would have improved the film considerably.  Instead, we\'re left with a film that hasn\'t a shred of realism.      There\'s no chemistry between the leads (Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood) and one can\'t help but wonder how two people, acquainted for a mere 24 hours (and who have spent perhaps 15 minutes together in that time), could be so ""in love.""  When she finds out that Beymer has just killed her brother, she dismisses it with hardly a comment.  It reeks of phoniness.     Most of the songs are OK, although I feel compelled to point out that ""Officer Krupke"" just may be the worst song ever written.  The dialogue, in trying to sound hip, instead sounds forced, and probably sounded phony even in 1961.  Finally, most of the Jets just don\'t seem like gang types. Imagine Wally and Beaver Cleaver as murderers and you have some concept of the Jets.      All in all, a colossal misfire, and one of the Academy\'s Best Picture blunders of all time.  3/10', ""The choreography, dancing and on location photography create excitement, but the story, an update of Romeo and Juliet, is trite, sugary and uninteresting.

Oscar winners Rita Moreno and George Chakiris give the only memorable performances.

But the effects are amazing and the vision of heaven is very original. Robin Williams is, as always, very good at performing. This was the first serious movie I saw featuring Williams, and I was amazed. I had thought Williams would be the type who could only act decently in comedies, but this one proved me wrong. He can put down a serious character with all ease not only that, he can truly touch you with his oh so tear-jerking lines.My conclusion: if you are planning on watching this movie, keep your tissues at hand, and some food and drinks as well since the movie isn't exactly what you call short."", ""I'd never watched this film when it was released. It's taken me 20 years to finally watch it, and though film-making has advanced technologically in terms of CGI in that time - it still looks stunning ! It's a slow burning story and there's not much joy and laughs - but the sense of love and family and resoluteness still lingered way after the film ended. It's concept of Heaven and Hell is way beyond conventional film directors. It's a labour of love which at the end is faith affirming and yet shows up all our human flaws and vulnerability in all their glory. Great direction - good acting and an incredible journey that will stay in your mind ."", 'To hell with the critics and the cynics.  I absolutely love this movie - it\'s in my top ten (or maybe even top five) list of favorite movies (I saw it at least 3 times in the theater and own it on DVD).  I have to admit, I\'m one of those non- (almost anti-) elitist, ""I don\'t know art, but I know what I like"" type people.  I also truly love positive, upbeat movies with happy endings.  Not to say that ""realistic"" movies aren\'t also great, but there is room for everything in the moviemaking genre.  Isn\'t there enough depressing ""realism"" on the evening news to satisfy even the most jaded cynic?I can\'t say exactly what it is that strikes me about this movie.  The incredible color-saturated visuals and special effects certainly help.  The acting talents of Robin Williams and Max Von Sydow help.   And I loved the story.  Emotionally manipulative it may be, but this is one of those films where I WANTED to be manipulated, where I willingly participated. Apparently some people resented it, but I was sobbing through much the movie, and glad to be doing so.  Laugh if you please, say whatever you want... this movie touches my heart.""Deep"" it isn\'t, not terribly.  On a metaphysical level, it goes only slightly beyond new-age kitsch.  Very few of the afterlife scenes and concepts agree with the spiritual outlook of any known religion.  But I don\'t care.  Again, if a movie touches my heart in just the right place, I can forgive it almost anything.  This one did.  9/10.', ""Given the recent loss of the incredible talent of Robin Williams I found this film incredibly moving. Ir made me think about what his heaven would be like, if he was watching his family grieve and I hope he's found peace. This film hits home for a lot of us, obviously because Robin killed himself. I don't believe people who commit suicide out of sadness or loss of hope go to hell, I believe they go to heaven like everyone else - Maybe that's just me being idealistic. As a film though, this moved me a lot. It was quite a sad film but at the same time there were moments of joy and sweetness. The acting was superb. I've never seen Robin act in this kind of role and I think it brought out his gentle, loving side people who knew him often spoke about. He spoke with this fascinating softness that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside.I feel he should be more well know for this role because its a great film. Annabella was also brilliant , she really brought out the raw emotion and pain a widow goes through after not only losing her children but then her husband. Although Cuba played a small part in this, his was also a great piece of acting (I wouldn't expect anything less from him). I cried a lot through this film, all for various reasons including the death of Robin and that pain of seeing him being wonderful and I am really going to miss him, also the film was very moving and does make you think, it also made me think of my life and what I'd do if certain people tragically left my life. So it hit home on quite a few levels. For its time the CG is actually pretty good, I've seen worse CG in films nowadays. Anyway, a fantastic film and anyone wishing to see a moving performance by Robin should watch this, he's incredible and always will be. I hope he's in his own private heaven at peace right now.""]",4,"['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Romance']"
What Happens in Vegas,3.65,4.0,"['Comedy', 'Romance']","A man and a woman are compelled, for legal reasons, to live life as a couple for a limited period of time. At stake is a large amount of money.",sadness,"[""I went to see this movie at the cinema with my girlfriend, my girlfriend thought it was OK. However I didn't like it.Like in all American films there are the crap ones, the alright ones, and there are the brilliant classics.It's funny in places, but not funny enough for you to still be laughing at it in a years time, or even after you come out of the cinema.Another reason why we went to see it was because Ashton Kutcher is fantastic in comedies, he was brilliant in 'Cheaper by the Dozen' And of course Cameron Diaz was in it and she's a good actress.If you're looking for some laughs and you've got nothing else to do on one rainy day go and see it. Otherwise don't bother, and wait for the DVD to come out.Overall it's a mildly entertaining film and some funny parts, but the plot drags on."", '""What Happens in Vegas"" reminds me of that great ""Seinfeld"" episode; the one where Jerry and George create a sitcom pilot about a traffic accident that results in the guy without insurance being the butler of the other man. It\'s the idiot plot, a concept that ""Vegas"" indulges in like a free buffet dinner. The movie proves that what happens in Vegas should sometimes just stay on the cutting room floor. The movie stars Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher as Joy and Jack. Joy got dumped by her boyfriend while Jack just got fired from his job. Both needing a pick-me-up, they are convinced by their friends (Rob Corddry, Lake Bell) to take a trip to Vegas, and after one wild and drunken night, the two wake up in the morning to find each other lying in holy matrimony. Not only that, but while trying to end the marriage, Jack wins a huge jackpot after playing Joy\'s quarter, throwing a wrench into the divorce proceedings. Whoever gets the other to divorce them first is entitled to the money, and so the ""happy"" couple move in with one another and hatch escalating schemes in order get the other to bail out of the marriage first. Only if you\'ve seen this kind of thing before, what do you think happens when they come back from Vegas? It\'s a contrived sitcom from the start. Even before I went in I knew what I was getting myself into. Still, if the movie was funny it would more than make up for the complete lack of anything new. I was surprised with the kinetic and wild energy that director Tom Vaughan brings to the opening Vegas scenes, as it almost made me think that this movie may actually be likable. But then these two idiots wake up married and the movie slows to a halt. They each find one witless and unfunny way after another to get on the other\'s nerves. Joy hogs the bathroom, Jack pees in the sink, Jack rubs his balls then handles food, Joy throws food at him. At one point Jack gives himself a black eye to show that Joy is abusive. The movie wouldn\'t dare do it the other way around because, of course, spousal abuse on a wife isn\'t nearly as hilarious. I don\'t know what\'s more insulting, that the movie finds this crap funny or that in the last half it expects us to buy this phony romance based on life lessons and profound understanding. And then you have Kutcher and Diaz, two likable actors forced to play with bottom of the barrel material. Kutcher seems to know the material is terrible and tries to be comedic in his own way but the effort turns out to be more obnoxious and over-wrought instead. And Diaz is just shrill and unpleasant. We don\'t buy it when these two turn from being incredibly mean and nasty to one another to actually understanding the other and so the romance just flounders. On the upside, Rob Corddry is in the movie and he is fastly becoming comedy\'s best supporting player. ""What Happens in Vegas"" is just dumb. I expected nothing less, was hoping to be surprised with more, but am completely un-surprised by what I got. Sometimes you just have to roll the dice and see what happens though. Snake eyes!', ""Nothing new here. Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher play as opposites who, after to many drinks, marry each other and then win a three million dollar jackpot from a slot machine. The courts have ordered them to stay married for six months with therapy, but a further revelation shows that whoever divorces first loses the money. Of course they make each other's life hell, and if you cant already see what is going to happen the there could be something wrong. A few good chuckles here and there but there is barely any chemistry between the two leads who are completely mismatched. To predictable and not enough laughs to be anything memorable. Co stars Queen Latifah."", ""When I first saw the trailer to What Happens in Vegas..., I thought it did look so predictable, but it had some really funny moments in the trailer, so I still wanted to see it. The only sad part, we have Cameron Diaz(who looks like a really good looking aging woman) and Ashton Kutcher(who still looks and acts like he's 12 years old), so we have two obnoxious actors that could have made a very disastrous film. But I saw What Happens in Vegas... yesterday and even though it was very predictable and stupid, it still had some very funny moments. I mean, Cameron and Ashton play two of the most unlikeable characters in movie history, who just bicker back and forth. The characters who win you over in the film are Rob Corddry and Lake Bell, who's fighting is actually very funny. But Aston and Cameron had some really good moments too.Joy just got dumped by her boyfriend in front of her friends, Jack just got fired by his own father, so what's next for them? VEGAS! They happen to meet when their rooms get mixed up and end up drinking together, having a ball in Vegas, and end up accidentally marrying each other. When they come too, they realize it was a mistake, but start bickering, Joy leaves a quarter at her slot machine and Jack puts it in and wins 3 million dollars! But when it comes to the annulment, for some strange and unbelievable reason, the judge sentences them to 6 months hard marriage and freezes the money. So these two who have nothing in common battle it out, until of course they fall for each other.What Happens in Vegas... is silly and predictable, but I do think the rating her on IMDb is a little harsh. I completely side with people who hate Cameron and Ashton, but their battle scenes together are pretty funny. Just I've seen so many worse films, this was just a fun romantic comedy to lighten the spirit of Iron Man and Speed Racer, not to mention the more action packed movies for the summer. So I'd say it's worth the look, but more of a rental vs. a high priced ticket, but just have fun, I think you'll get more than a few laughs.5/10"", 'I was in fear of going to see this movie.The reviews were appalling. At the last minute I relented and went expecting the worst. I was pleasantly surprised after 10 minutes my fears were dispelled and I actually started to enjoy the film. The basis of the film was predictable but the way the 2 central characters draw you in surprised me. They worked very well together and played off each other very well. Yes there are 1 or 2 silly scenes but it was still funny.I think the best thing about this comedy was that it left it up to the audience to draw their own conclusions on the characters of the central characters without laying (on as Hollywood usually does)it on heavy with the romantic or schmuty character embellishment.Just a funny story with 2 ( 4 including the supporting friends) very good comic actors. Give yourself a break its not overly typical Hollywood flick and I found it funny anyway ! PS I am not a teenager !', ""All you have to do is watch the trailer for this movie and you know generally how it's going to pan out. And even while watching it, it's pretty predictable.However, in saying that, it certainly had its moments. Ashton Kutcher plays the usual role, Cameron Diaz looks good and acts bad as always, Rob Corddry is hilarious in a secondary role as Kutcher's bumbling lawyer friend and the very attractive Lake Bell provides some more wit as Diaz best friend.Overall, it definitely exceeded my expectations and I enjoyed the majority of it (with the exception of a few, forced sappy moments).Worth my money? Yes, cause it was cheap night and only cost me $4.20! Worth your $10? Not really. Just rent it when it comes out."", 'My only trip to the US (not counting the toddler days) where I can remember what the heck I was doing, was back in December 2005 (gee, time flies!) where I spent a total of 7 full days trawling the streets as well as the casinos up and down the Strip and its outskirts, and seriously, it\'s never as sexy as that portrayed in the movies (or that television series), though you\'d truly never really run out of things to do, despite everything being overly expensive at tourist prices. I think I still possess a mental map of everything on the Strip!And of course, Vegas is famous amongst other things besides the Elvis impersonators, live entertainment etc, is the ability to conduct quicky marriages, which is what Ashton Kutcher\'s Jack Fuller and Cameron Diaz\'s Joy McNally get themselves into during a night of drunken stupor and cheap dares, two lonely souls who journey to Sin City as an escapism from their failed lives, where you can enjoy all the pleasures the city have to offer, before the drudge comes kicking in when you receive that credit card bill.So begins the story when the duo find themselves in a situation to annul their marriage given a night of impulse that they cannot remember, but cannot do so when McNally\'s quarter was inserted into a jackpot machine by Fuller, and that brought them a cool 3 million dollars jackpot. Which they can\'t agree how to split the money, and a quirky judge sentenced them to 6 months ""hard marriage"" to work through their marital vows, before their frozen cash can be touched. As what the trailer had already explicitly spelt out, it\'s War of the Roses in Mr and Mrs Smith styled couch-therapy sessions by Queen Latifah, with comedy ranging from the slapstick, to the plain juvenile toilet tricks.Attempts to elevate the movie and give the characters more depth, come in the form of Jack Fuller learning to believe in himself and to shed his playboy, non-committal ways, and with Joy McNally having to learn to let her hair down, lighten up, and basically doing something she loves rather than to continue doing things that she dislikes, in true ""live your dream"" fashion. And throw in a quirky boss and ideal parents into the mix, you\'d have a whole host of supporting cast to boost variety in this rather predictable tale, where you can see the outcome shining brightly like a star in a moonless night.I thought Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz could be playing themselves, i.e. one\'s dating an older woman, the other other no qualms in dating younger men. Well, at least their characters had never felt the need to reveal their ages, but you can tell Diaz is a spring chicken no longer since her big screen debut in The Mask. Typical of all her roles, Diaz again plays a ditzy blonde with quirky skill sets, and I thought somebody should really consider giving her a role in an action movie, since she has on display, really menacing looking biceps, and a scene where she got to show off her combo moves of a right hook and reverse roundhouse kick.Kutcher on the other hand is, well, Kutcher from Punk\'d, with nothing really new offered in his role of the smooth talking slacker with brooding good looks. Instead, the one who stole the show was sidekick Rob Corddry as Hater, Fuller\'s best friend and lawyer. He would already be familiar to some as the crazy Homeland Security agent in Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay, and I\'d stick my neck out to say this is one guy to watch over the next few comedic movies, as he totally let it rip in this movie with his crazy antics.At best, What Happens in Vegas is ideal for those itching for yet another formulaic romantic- comedy from the factories of Hollywood, or for those who missed out on the hot tickets for Speed Racer. Stay behind after the end credits roll for a final coda. There are 2 at the beginning of the end credits, but hold out right until the end before you decide to make for the exit.', ""When I think of the RomCom genre I see 2 people meeting by accident, not getting along, circling around each other for 1 hour and then in the end, by magic, finally seeing the beauty in each other and living happily ever after. Im not saying that this movie is all that better or even different from that, but its one of the few in the genre that actually made me laugh out loud a couple of times.The story is pretty plain, 2 people have to go on with this drunken Vegas marriage to get the 1,5 million each that they won, they struggle hard to make the other one give up on it. This is the setting for most of the film and it gives the viewer some really familiar every day situations pushed to the extreme, the interaction between Cameron and Ashton is working out well all through the movie, they really seem to be having fun acting their parts.I don't understand why this movie is at a 5.1 rating, sure its nothing new, sure its not the best storyline you have ever seen, but its good clear fun if you are looking for just that, nothing more nothing less."", 'Following a wild night of too many drinks in Las Vegas, Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher, wake up to discover that they are married in this funny and colorful romantic comedy\x85 But after a huge, disputed win at a casino, the neurotic newlyweds end up in court fighting over the grand prize\x85To try to make things work, the weary judge (Dennis Miller) freezes the money and sentences them to ""six months hard marriage"" to make them learn how to live together as man and wife, and maybe, eventually, they will really fall in love\x85 Diaz and Kutcher work together well on screen\x85 They are appealing, and they bring some really comic moments\x85 Their performances make us smile\x85Some of the supporting cast showed off their talent and managed to steal a few genuine laughs...The movie is enjoyable, and director Tom Vaughan did a decent job', 'A lazy young man who\'s just been fired by his own father and an uptight financial sector striver just dumped by her boyfriend go to Las Vegas with pals to forget and, meeting, get married in a night of drunken carousing and diminished rationality. Then he wins $3 million on a slot machine with her quarter and they wind up in court fighting over an annulment and the right to the three million. The judge dislikes them both equally and sentences them to remain married and cohabit for six months and prove they\'re working to get along. A series of domestic plots and battles follows as each tries to outsmart the other to win in court and get all the money. They end up liking each other. I know the reviewers are right to trash this movie, but they\'re missing something essential that would raise the audience rating a good many points above the critics\' if they fail to note one thing that is the main reason why most of us go to see it. \'What Happens in Vegas\' has not only the trappings of a big, expensive Hollywood comedy, the bright colors and nice sets, but two big glamorous stars, and they are not humiliated by being here, because they do look very good, and mismatch or not, look good together too. Yes, the script is lousy. The setups and jokes are lame and clichéd and sometimes crass, tasteless, and adolescent. The arc is predictable. The progression isn\'t particularly interesting or even logical. The individual scenes consequently aren\'t ever pitched to be very funny and the dialog never surprises you either. But that very lack of high pitched comedy can be a plus if you find Cameron amazing and cool and Ashton gorgeous and appealing. The absence of a high laugh level such as the Apatow comedies occasionally achieve means they get to act more like people; they can register ordinary expressions instead of mere comic mugging and you get to look at them, which is one good and durable reason for watching this movie. And both are aging well. Ashton is big and handsome. The pretty-boy quality is fading into something more like an old time Hollywood leading man look. Cameron is sexy and elegant and looks great in a tight gown. Ashton has learned something since the staccato limitations of ""That Seventies Show."" He actually registers six or seven different, and recognizably human, expressions now. He\'s added sarcasm and meanness. He may be a people-pleaser forever, but he doesn\'t try as hard as he used to, nor does the good old boy personality hide a certain level of intelligence, just as the ""Punk\'d"" bad-ass persona has never hidden an essential kindness. The one plot element that works is that he\'s the one of the pair who\'s got the emotional smarts; it is harder to believe Cameron\'s character is as cut off from feeling as she\'s supposed to be. But not too hard, because there\'s a hardness about her.Yes, it is disappointing that most of the Vegas night is done in a rapid-fire montage that\'s more like an acid trip than an evening of heavy drinking; that nothing sexier happens; that the wedding is reduced to a final (not very successful) outtake sequence. The ending is slushy sentimental; but it is sweet. The critics\' revulsion remains incomprehensible to me because \'What Happens in Vegas\' leaves a good taste, if not a very strong one. I was a little bothered by the young Asian woman (a misused Michelle Krusiec) being made so stereotypically the unappealing suffering striver: that\'s more mean than funny. Queen Latifah is mellow as always but wasted as the marriage counselor. Director Tom Vaughan deserves little credit, but it is writer Dana Fox who is most to blame for the mediocrity of the result. Kutcher and Diaz and the others do a very good job. When you think about it, how much is the ""originality"" of other recent Hollywood comedies really worth? Where\'s the trail-blazing in \'40 Year Old Virgin,\' \'Super Bad,\' or even the wishful-thinking \'Juno\'? But no mistake about it, this movie is for fans of good-looking people in glossy movies, not smart comedy or edge. Compare this to Ashton in \'Just Married\' and you\'ll see this role is better. For sheer mindless fun he peaked in \'Dude, Where\'s My Car?\' Of course Cameron has a far stronger comedy--and general movie--résumé, so again Ashton\'s playing opposite her is not a step back but a step forward. But an attempt to analyze the plot seems futile. Its failings are too obvious to bother listing.', 'Alright, before you watch this movie, you know it is not going to be some deep, poetic Best Picture nominee. I was not all that excited about seeing it in the first place myself if I am going to be honest, but I only got it because there was nothing better to get I guess, and in the end, I had a fun time with it. Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz have good chemistry on set, not exactly Gone with the Wind type of romance, but enough to make it feel somewhat believable and make these characters interact well with the plot.The movie is quite humorous. Not one of the funniest or even most memorable Rom-Coms I have ever seen, but here again, it does not try to be anything more than it is. The story is cute and entertaining if you give it even the slightest bit of chance to be, and though I would say if you are looking for a Rom-Com for you and your significant other there are plenty of better ones like The Proposal and The Ugly Truth you could see, if you have any interest in seeing this, I encourage you to do it because if you know what you are in for, it will be just what you needed. A refreshing little movie that deserves better reception.', 'The clumsy and reckless Jack Fuller (Ashton Kutcher) is fired by his boss and father (Treat Williams) and together with his friend and unsuccessful lawyer Hater (Rob Corddry), they decide to go to Las Vegas to have a good time. Meanwhile the fiancé of the workaholic stock broker Joy McNally (Cameron Diaz) breaks up their engagement because of her lack of attitude. Her friend and bartender Tipper (Lake Bell) convinces Joy to spend a couple of days also in Las Vegas. Due to a hotel management mistake, they are lodged in the same room and later they hang around together. During the night, they get completely wasted and on the next morning, Jack and Joy find that they got married. While discussing to briefly end their wedding, Jack borrows a coin from Joy to gamble in the jackpot machine and wins three million dollars. They question in court the ownership of the money and the conservative Judge R. D. Whopper (Dennis Miller) freezes the money and sentence them to live together with Joy moving to Jack\'s house for six months and attending regular counseling sessions. Each one decides to make the life of the other hell on Earth to force to get out of the marriage.""What Happens in Vegas"" is silly, but one of the most delightful romantic comedies I have recently seen. There are many hilarious scenes that made me laugh a lot in my flight; the gorgeous, sexy and funny Cameron Diaz shows a wonderful chemistry with Ashton Kutcher that performs his traditional role of a goofy guy. My only remark is that it is hard to believe that a man could resist the charm of Cameron Diaz living together with her. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Jogo de Amor em Las Vegas"" (""Game of Love in Las Vegas"")', 'What Happens In Vegas was a very good romantic comedy. It was very funny and had you laughing at pretty much every scene. It was a laugh out loud comedy. Ashton Kutcher was very good and made this movie so funny. Cameron Diaz was funny as well and played her part very well. I thought that the story was very original and funny. I think that it was unique and a very cute story. It seems like every romantic comedy movie is all the same now, but this was different in a good way. Their was a ton of adult humor in this. It was mostly all humor and many jokes between the married couple. I think they picked the perfect actors to play the parts. They worked so well together in this and were very cute. The messages were very good in this movie. A couple of the messages were about spending your life with who you are meant to be with. Most of the scenes that they show in the trailer are all in the movie as well. Overall this was a very good comedy movie to start the summer off with. Give this movie a chance you will probably like it. You will especially like it if you are a fan of very funny comedy movies.', ""I saw this movie today and I can say it's a very funny movie. Surely, isn't the next Oscar winner, but it's a very enjoyable movie that can make you laugh and laugh for like 2 hours. The actors are very good on their roles and let's be sincere: Ashton Kutcher IS funny! And Cameron Diaz make it funnier even if she's not so funny if she don't have good actors working with her. If you like love comedies you should see this movie, but if you are looking something more brainy...keep walking. Give it a chance! You won't regret.

And boy am i glad that i watched it. It is the best comedy to come out in a really long time, and i mean that 100%. It was fast - comedies loose their charm when they tend to go slow on you - quick in getting to the main story instead of lagging us on and on, and surprisingly the Vegas section was pretty small which was actually a Plus point! The acting was superb, some of the scenes were just hilarious, and others were great. The ending was expected, but then for such movies it is...All i can say is that it was after a really long time that i watched most of the movie again and again (yes twice) right after i had completed it.In short... if you want to have a great time and some good laughs then give this a go.

Mel Gibson plays a womanizing ad-exec in Chicago who--through electrocution!--is suddenly able to read the minds of all females. At first, he uses this newfound gift for personal gain, but soon finds himself becoming a more caring and sensitive man who learns to listen before he speaks. Fast-paced but dim, fatuous comic fantasy of male and female relations in modern times. It purports to be speaking the Truth about the sexes, but in the interim tosses off a lot of snappy lines and superficial answers. Most of the female performers are directed to be hammy and irritating, and nearly everyone in the cast overacts. Gibson manages to retain his appeal, though even he can't save the film from a sour finish. ** from ****"", ""Well, to like this film, you've really got to like the lovely Mel. And while he's had his moments in the past, he is just starting to get .... on.... my....nerves. OK, the character is _meant_ to be obnoxious, in order to give the film its comedic spin, but boy does Mel smarm and squirm his way through the role. As most other comments have said, the women characters, particularly Tomei, are woefully underdeveloped and underused, leaving the film to stand and fall on Gibson's performance.The plot lurches along too: Tomei is written out with an unbelievable plot device, the 'daughter' sub plot is predictable and the ending just doesn't convince.As said, you like Mel, you get Mel.

Dig this: Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) gets electrocuted by a hairdryer and when he comes to his senses again, he can actually READ women's minds!! What a treat that must be! Last time I suffered slight electrocution I was shivering for 3 days and Gibson gets to understand women??? Anyway\x85about the film. It all may look fresh and light-headed but in fact it's pretty routine and annoyingly superficial! We learn that the stuff women think about is actually ordinary and rather obvious (they don't want to get hurt emotionally, they want to prove that there's more to them than just a pretty face etc etc\x85) The screenplay contains a few major clichés, like tremendous emotional speeches and Gibson who automatically gets mistaken for a gay man. Or that dreadful moral about waiting for your `first time' till you're ready for it yourself?? Yuck! As far as I'm concerned, they could have done much better things with this basic idea. There are a few positive aspects to discover as well, of course. The acting for example. Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt are a terrific on-screen couple and I really wish they had been given a better script to work with. Some good acting by familiar faces in smaller roles as well, such as Alan Alda, Lauren Holly, Marisa Tomei and even Bette Midler. `What Women Want' has got a high level of feel-good moments and feminisation message, but it's overall pretty neutral.

Slated for a promotion, he is dismayed when he is not. Instead another executive, a female, Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt) is chosen. Believing he is cursed, he seeks a doctor who convinces him it\'s not a curse, but a blessing. Although, there is much to learn, Marshall soon adapts and uses his power to sabotage Darcy and her efforts. Alan Alda plays Dan Wanamaker, Gibson\'s boss, with Marisa Tomei, Delta Burke and Valerie Perrine in supporting roles, this movie sails well, until the principals meet to resolve their predicament, which in this reviewer\'s opinion, leaves much to be desired.

It succeeds pretty well, however the way the character gains and loses the ability were handled somewhat poorly. The humor is good, and there is plenty of it, throughout the entire runtime.

It\'s a good way to understand and know them better.The first hour of this movie is great fun, very entertaining and pure comedy. During the first hour we have some moments to give us good laughs. Mel Gibson has never been this funny before. He plays a hilarious character: Nick Marshall, a typical ""macho men"" or a ""men\'s man"". The kind of man that other men admire and want to be like him. The kind of man who doesn\'t understand a thing about women (although seen as a ""God\'s gift"" to women). Nick is proud, rich, chauvinistic, single and loves to hear Frank Sinatra.After an accident with the hairdryer, he suddenly has the power of hearing what women think and what they think of him isn\'t what he expected. He sees this as a curse, but after being convinced by a psychologist that he could take advantage of this gift, he uses it to manipulate Darcy McGuire.However, in the second half, the movie fails, becoming predictable and somehow lame, losing all its comical side. Some ridiculous and silly things happen in the second half. Also, I rather the ""old"" Nick than the ""good"" Nick, because the ""old"" Nick was much funnier. He becomes the ""good guy"" in the second half, losing his sense of humor.This movie has some nice songs, such as ""I Won\'t Dance"" (performed by Frank Sinatra), ""I\'ve Got You Under My Skin"" (performed by Frank Sinatra in a duet with Bono) and ""Bitch"" (performed by Meredith Brooks).Mel Gibson is great and charming as Nick Marshall, while Helen Hunt is okay and pretty in the role of Darcy McGuire.', 'Mel Gibson is known as sort of a macho action hero, and stereotyped into his Mad Max/Martin Riggs persona.

On and off the camera, he has an incredible sense of humor, and he probably improvised some featured gags.The premise is very original and interesting.  A guy who can hear a woman\'s every thought?  That\'s pretty much every man\'s fantasy.  And the premise is used wisely.  I laughed the whole way through!  It\'s hilarious to watch Gibson emasculating himself by the minute, and the joke never runs dry. \nI was laughing so much that I was able to tolerate the film\'s corny ending.

""What Women Want"" is an original, feel-good comedy that will have you on the floor!  This not a ""chick flick.""  If you want to laugh--this is the movie to see!  No questions asked!My score:  8 (out of 10)', ""Here is a movie that, to be sure, is part fantasy, part wacky comedy; but to call `What Women Want,' directed by Nancy Meyers, `just' a comedy would be not only inaccurate, but would be doing an injustice to the film as well. Because-- while there are plenty of laughs to be had (especially early on)-- in the end, there is a lot more bite and substance to it than first meets the eye.  Enough to definitely raise it far above the `fluff' piece many will perceive it to be, if only due to some shallow reviews and the theatrical trailer currently being shown, which gives only the vaguest notion of what this movie is really all about.  In fact, once most of the `cute' stuff is out of the way (about a third of the way through), the film really starts to get good,with a message about decency that is worthwhile, if only it can penetrate the formidable barrier of the viewer with an attention span barely able to accommodate an episode of `Friends.'  Beyond the humor, there is a story here about a man named Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) who literally receives the shock of his life, and afterwards must deal with who he is by coming to terms with his past, realizing the truth about himself in the present, and understanding what his future will be if he does not change his ways .  It's something of a contemporary take on `A Christmas Carol,' with Nick an egotistical, self-centered, witty (In his own eyes) Scrooge; a veritable legend in his own mind, which is not-- as he comes to find out-- necessarily the way he is perceived by many of those around him, especially the women in his professional life. \tThe screenplay, written by Cathy Yuspa and Josh Goldsmith, is extremely insightful and brought to the screen with equal acuity by director Meyers, who goes to great lengths at the beginning of the film to explain Nick's exaggerated chauvinism, what made him the `Man's man' he has become.  And while it is clever and effective, closer scrutiny in the editing room may have benefited the overall film, as his character is somewhat `overly' established.  But just about at the point when you're saying to yourself, `All right I get it!' Meyers grabs the helm with both hands and suddenly the ship is at full mast and on course, where she keeps it for the rest of the journey.  The turning point comes after Nick's visit to a marriage counselor (a terrific cameo by Bette Midler) with whom he had had business some years before.  It's as if not only Nick, but Meyers as well, had heeded Bette's advice. \tMel Gibson does a good job of getting into Nick Marshall's skin, and he's to be commended for going out on a limb and taking on a character that may not be immediately embraced by even die-hard Gibson fans.  It's a testimony to his ability as an actor, though, because he does make Nick the epitome of chauvinism, and except for the few throw-back Neanderthals (women as well as men) still in existence who subscribe to the `Man's man' theory of de-evolution, Nick will effect the same response from the audience that he does in the minds of many of the women who surround him in the movie.  It's only when you've had a chance to consider Gibson's performance at arm's length that you will realize how good he is in this film.  On the other hand, the real saving grace of this movie is immediately discernible, and that is the performance of the wonderful Helen Hunt.  As Darcy McGuire, the professional hired to lead the ad agency for whom Nick works into the Twenty-first Century, Hunt is nothing less than sensational.  One of the most gifted, expressive actors in the business, she raises the level of the drama (not to mention the comedy) by succinctly conveying the strength-- and at the same time the vulnerability-- of Darcy, while exhibiting a depth of emotion that adds so much to the impact (and the success) of the film. And, in a notable supporting role, Judy Greer is memorable as Erin, a lonely young woman who works at the ad agency.  It's the `Tiny Tim' role of the film, and though a small part, it figures prominently in revealing Nick's inner-most feelings at a pivotal moment of the film. \tRounding out the supporting cast are Alan Alda (Dan), Marisa Tomei (Lola), Ashley Johnson (Alexandra), Mark Feuerstein (Morgan), Lauren Holly (Gigi), Delta Burke (Eve), Valerie Perrine (Margo) and Sarah Paulson (Annie).  What Meyers has created here is a mixed-bag, sleight-of-hand bit of entertainment that is so much more than what it seems to be on the surface that it is bound to evoke an equally mixed-bag of reactions (positive and negative) from the audience.  It's amusing-- downright funny at times-- but also exasperating.  To receive the full rewards offered by `What Women Want,' you're going to have to give it something as well.  If you do, you'll be pleasantly surprised by what you get in return.  And that, my friends, is the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10."", ""This movie is one of Mel Gibsons best!

A great plot, a social statement, and a truly inspiring love story, this movie has it all, including some very very funny parts. This is not a no-brainer slap stick comedy but one that makes you think about our interaction with other people and how it effects them and you.

But eventually (around the part I mentioned) I realized that it\'s very funny. And you\'ve gotta love the romance!Mel Gibson is Nick Marshall, a womanizer who at the same time doesn\'t understand women at all. When the womanliest of all women, Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt), starts to work with his company, she assigns everyone to think of advertising ideas for at least one feminine item in the boxes she gives them (pantyhose, lipstick, mascara, a wonderbra, nail polish, etc.). Nick tries to think, but instead gets drunk and paints his nails, tries on the mascara and pantyhose, and yes, waxes his legs. That night, a freak accident occurs in his apartment, and then he can hear what women are thinking. He uses this asset to steal Darcy\'s ideas, and at the same time falls in love with her.Besides Gibson and Hunt\'s performances, there are three other reasons I love this movie. One, Marisa Tomei, who is perky and cute as Nick\'s previous uninterested love interest, a coffee-shop girl named Lola. But just when Nick gets less desperate for her and more so for Darcy, Lola discovers that she really does like him. Two, Ashley Johnson, who is demanding but lovable as Nick\'s teenage daughter from a previous marriage. He can hear her thoughts, too, and finds out that she\'s planning to lose her virginity on prom night. Although he tries to stop her, she eventually learns the lesson on her own. Three, it has an awesome soundtrack. Frank Sinatra, the Temptations, Nancy Wilson, and Bobby Darin sing old classics, while Christina Agulera and Meredith Brooks perform fairly new hits.Anybody who likes comedy, romance, or just a great movie should see ""What Women Want.""

It had me laughing, talking to the characters (mainly ""Oh, no!"" and ""Watch out!""), and eager to see what would happen next. I guess it\'s true that women are difficult for men to understand because what we\'re are thinking often contradicts what we\'re saying. What DO women want? The casting was wonderful, the acting was superb, and the direction was perfect. I heard that Tim Allan had been considered for the lead role. He would\'ve been a great choice, but so was Mel Gibson. Bravo to one and all! Now how about doing a similar movie with a woman hearing men\'s thoughts, hmmmm?

Mel Gibson plays a womanizing ad-exec in Chicago who--through electrocution!--is suddenly able to read the minds of all females. At first, he uses this newfound gift for personal gain, but soon finds himself becoming a more caring and sensitive man who learns to listen before he speaks. Fast-paced but dim, fatuous comic fantasy of male and female relations in modern times. It purports to be speaking the Truth about the sexes, but in the interim tosses off a lot of snappy lines and superficial answers. Most of the female performers are directed to be hammy and irritating, and nearly everyone in the cast overacts. Gibson manages to retain his appeal, though even he can't save the film from a sour finish. ** from ****"", ""Well, to like this film, you've really got to like the lovely Mel. And while he's had his moments in the past, he is just starting to get .... on.... my....nerves. OK, the character is _meant_ to be obnoxious, in order to give the film its comedic spin, but boy does Mel smarm and squirm his way through the role. As most other comments have said, the women characters, particularly Tomei, are woefully underdeveloped and underused, leaving the film to stand and fall on Gibson's performance.The plot lurches along too: Tomei is written out with an unbelievable plot device, the 'daughter' sub plot is predictable and the ending just doesn't convince.As said, you like Mel, you get Mel. But if you're looking for sensible plot and believable characters, try elsewhere. It's almost as if the great Mel decided there just wasn't enough room in the film for anything else."", ""Every once and a while there comes a movie of which you really regret the fact that it's premise is just fiction\x85 Life would so much easier if this was true. Dig this: Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) gets electrocuted by a hairdryer and when he comes to his senses again, he can actually READ women's minds!! What a treat that must be! Last time I suffered slight electrocution I was shivering for 3 days and Gibson gets to understand women??? Anyway\x85about the film. It all may look fresh and light-headed but in fact it's pretty routine and annoyingly superficial! We learn that the stuff women think about is actually ordinary and rather obvious (they don't want to get hurt emotionally, they want to prove that there's more to them than just a pretty face etc etc\x85) The screenplay contains a few major clichés, like tremendous emotional speeches and Gibson who automatically gets mistaken for a gay man. Or that dreadful moral about waiting for your `first time' till you're ready for it yourself?? Yuck! As far as I'm concerned, they could have done much better things with this basic idea. There are a few positive aspects to discover as well, of course. The acting for example. Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt are a terrific on-screen couple and I really wish they had been given a better script to work with. Some good acting by familiar faces in smaller roles as well, such as Alan Alda, Lauren Holly, Marisa Tomei and even Bette Midler. `What Women Want' has got a high level of feel-good moments and feminisation message, but it's overall pretty neutral. Good, smooth soundtrack though\x85Lot's of Frank Sinatra oldies!I tend to know what women want as well\x85: this kind of cinema.

The book was called the \'games people play.\' This interesting, quirky, comedy movie is called "" What women want. "" It tells the story of a top Manhattan, executive, Nick Marshall, (Mel Gibson) in the advertising business who experiences a shocking electrical accident which leaves him with the ability to read women\'s minds. Much like another movie, \'The Misadventures of Merlin Jones.\' Although females at his place of employment consider him to be a snobbish, egocentric, male chauvinist and brutish womanizer, he sees himself the opposite. Slated for a promotion, he is dismayed when he is not. Instead another executive, a female, Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt) is chosen. Believing he is cursed, he seeks a doctor who convinces him it\'s not a curse, but a blessing. Although, there is much to learn, Marshall soon adapts and uses his power to sabotage Darcy and her efforts. Alan Alda plays Dan Wanamaker, Gibson\'s boss, with Marisa Tomei, Delta Burke and Valerie Perrine in supporting roles, this movie sails well, until the principals meet to resolve their predicament, which in this reviewer\'s opinion, leaves much to be desired.

Don't watch it it is a waste of both time and money.The only good I can say is about the main character, the girl, Amanda Bynes,. she is quite a woman, but it does not help much with this kind of bad movie she is acting. I would not even compare this movie to some Hollywood classics or good comedies. Mayvbe this movie would be for teenage girls"", ""Put an attractive, young tv-star in an airplane to Europe and you got your movie-hit. Where Hillary Duff went to Italy and became a singer, Amanda Bynes tries out England to meet her father, some big hot-shot up and coming politician. And those are just two movies from last year. The complete list of comparable stories is endless...We've all seen it before. Nice mom, cute girl, mean stepsister, father is about to mary to wrong woman... or maybe he doesn't? It's as cliched as it gets, but 'What a girl wants' wasn't as bad as many of those movies, nor as irritating as the 'going to Europe' 'Lizzie McGuire' movie.The big plus for the movie are it's main characters. Amanda Bynes is perfect in her role as young American girl discovering London, and Colin Firth is always a pleasure to watch (even though he played in the dreadful 'Bridget Jones' movie).A couple of things bugged me though. First off, those Englishmen have a serious security breach, with Bynes breaking in the house of a Lord and later breaking in at a fashion show with Prince Charles attending. Somehow I guess not...Biggest problem though was the 'Ian' person. We all think Bynes is gonna fall for him but she doesn't phone him, and later on she goes back to America without even saying goodbye... such an odd thing to do for a girl in love.The story isn't mindboggling whatso-ever, but I'm sure it's 'what the girls want' who like the Bynes show in the USA. Way better than the Duff movie, that's for sure. 5/10."", 'As far as I\'m concerned, this movie gives us the perfect \'time out\' from the daily grind.  It\'s sweet, charming, and has a fine cast.  Outstanding, of course, is Colin Firth.  The reviewers who claim that this movie is great for the ""under-13 and over 80"" crowd just don\'t get it.  There are many of us who will love Mr. Darcy forever, and who are in dire need of more Colin Firth movies.  He is, of course, absolutely gorgeous in the movie, and has a lot of screen time.  I would pay to watch and listen to him read a telephone book, so I will see this movie again and definitely will be among the first in line to buy the DVD.It was strange to see Anna Chancellor as his fiancee, a part which she played in much the same way that she portrayed Caroline Bingley.  Her character wasn\'t good enough for Mr. Darcy, nor is this one suited for Lord Dashwood.Although numerous people have criticized the sweetness of the movie, I, who am hopelessly romantic, loved its ending. I left the theater feeling better than when I entered.  (I felt the same way when ""Bridget Jones\'s Diary"" ended.  Actually, I couldn\'t wait to see it again, since the final kiss was probably the best kiss I\'ve seen in a movie.  I digress. Sorry.) Although I realize that this movie isn\'t going to win any Academy Awards, it is still a wonderful way to spend an hour and a half.', 'I saw the movie with my mid-teen sister who\'s exactly the target audience of this film. Now there are many films that are not for everybody, they do not excel in acting, directing, screenplay or effects to be called a \'good movie\'. They are meant for certain part of the audience who, if it sticks to the specific formula, just love them. Now I wasn\'t meant to love ""What a girl wants"", but I guess, thinking from my point of view, it\'s a good diversion from me.The script is above the level I was expecting and young Amanda Bynes acted quite well. Colin Firth seemed a little wooden. There are bits of little innocent humors in places that makes it a relief to watch. The shooting locations and the sets are fine. The soundtrack too is catchy. So even the storyline is very very shallow, one should not complain or analyze too much about such films.', ""Dennie Gordon has directed this comedy with sure hand. The play by William Douglas-Home was a hit in the London stage and it was filmed before as The Reluctant Debutante with Rex Harrison, Kay Kendall, Sandra Dee, John Saxon and Angela Lansbury in the cast. This new take on the same story is fun basically because of the cast that was assembled to play the main characters.Amanda Bynes has the right amount of charm to make her Daphne an endearing teen who is in search for a father she never knew. Colin Firth is a very good as the father. Kelly Preston has very little to do and it's a shame. Eileen Atkins, as the would be grandmother doesn't fare better, as it's the case with Jonathan Pryce.I recently caught up with it on DVD format and all that can be said is that it was mildly amusing as a typical comedy of this genre."", 'I went into the theater today expecting a good movie. I was wrong. Why was I wrong? Because this was a GREAT movie!!!The trailers made this film look INSANELY cheesy.  Since I know from experience that trailers are highly inaccurate, I was expecting a PARTIALLY cheesy flick. But what I saw had almost no cheese to it at all. What A Girl Wants, despite its unfortunate title, is what a LOT of people want, combining drama, comedy, romance, and self-discovery in an hour and 45 minutes of enjoyment.I didn\'t say insight, mind you, I said self-discovery. This is purely a narrative, not a deep thought movie, and it wouldn\'t have worked any other way. Kudos to Dennie Gordon for not trying to accent a theme that we\'re already familiar with, rather, she just throws it into the story, almost casually, so that we see the message of individuality but aren\'t repulsed by an overly blatant moral.Many of this film\'s detractors say that it\'s a rip of The Princess Diaries. Not true. Yes, it\'s an adaptation, but it\'s based on ""The Reluctant Debutante"", which was around for DECADES before Diaries was even conceived. Besides, while it is a little formulaic, there are a few twists.\nMany say it portrays inaccurate American/British stereotypes. Not true. Daphne and her mother are CLEARLY presented to be NOTHING like the average American, and Lord Dashwood only behaves so properly because of his political position.Amanda Bynes as Daphne Reynolds finally gets a chance to show of her incredible dramatic skills. (Moody\'s Point had too much of a satirical tone to properly show this.) Bynes has her glory moments of comedy alongside her touching moments as the girl who wants to understand who she is.Colin Firth as Henry Dashwood. Come on, who didn\'t already know Firth kicks butt? He is the center of every scene Bynes isn\'t in, and he carries that weight well.Eileen Atkins as Lady Dashwood does a tremendous job with her supporting role, who is far more crucial to the plot than anyone expected.Oliver James handles his theatrical debut well, showing much more emotion than the previews indicated. Libby Reynolds isn\'t a fully round character, but that\'s the script\'s fault, not Kelly Preston\'s. Both are capable singers, and considering that Bynes\'s one major performance flaw is lack of musical ability, I\'m glad these two sang instead of her.\nIn fact, basically the entire cast here was superb.See it, you\'ll be glad you did. Fine entertainment for almost everybody.', ""I was actually surprised by this movie.  Yes, it was probably conceived by a marketing team.  Yes, it isn't very original and yes, some of it is embarassingly obvious.  That being said, I was very entertained by this movie.  I thought it was well directed, and well acted.  I wouldn't be surprised to see Amanda Bynes start taking on more serious roles in the future with great success.  This movie does what it set out to do: entertain teenage girls.  Anyone who is a fan of lighthearted tween comedies should check this movie out.  It is better than most of the teenage girl movies out there and much better than that stupid Big Fat Greek Wedding movie.  **1/2 out of ****"", 'I have read several reviews of this film, and I have to say that men just aren\'t going to ""get"" this one.  Our local paper\'s reviewer said he just didn\'t get the ""stars in the eyes"" of the women leaving the theater.  His review didn\'t even MENTION Colin Firth.  Well, I will!  Colin is what is going to attract women to this film, and he does not disappoint.  He is the best thing about the movie.  Amanda Bynes is cute, and I enjoyed her too. The rest of the cast is quite good too...Anna Chancellor (Caroline Bingley, for those Pride and Prejudice fans...), and Eileen Atkins, particularly.  I found the storyline about the daughter longing for her father and the father who just discovered her quite sweet and moving.  Yes, the script was a bit sloppy and the humor often falls flat, but overall, Colin Firth\'s performance made it worth seeing for me.  This is definitely a chick flick, though :)', ""The folks banging this movie have to get real.  It's about an average girl (Bynes) who gets to meet her dad, who's in the process of running for major political office in England.  It's not about Yankee superiority over the Brits (sheesh!), it's a simple fantasy about the effect a teenage girl has on her once-stuffy dad in stuffy society.  If you're politically offended by this movie, imagine Amanda as a carefree Portugese girl visiting her long-lost dad, a member of U.S. Congress from Massachusetts, and chill out. That being said, Amanda Bynes is a cool and attractive leading lady/girl and plays very well with the other characters in this film.  It's all been done millions of times before, and it's not Oscar material, but it was a pleasant diversion for me."", '""What a Girl Wants"" is a re-tooling/re-telling of William Douglas Home\'s ""The Reluctant Debutante"" with the devastatingly charming Amanda Bynes in the title role; in fact \'charming\' is the operative word here -everything about the movie is charming, and charmed.The casting: impeccably superb.  Amanda never hits a false note throughout the proceedings, creating a character who is genuinely believable, lovable and worth cheering for (there was a LOT of clapping in the theatre at various points in the film - I clapped AND whistled, myself); Kelly Preston is radiant as Daphne\'s mother Libby, a musician who still deeply loves Henry, Daphne\'s father, but has gone on with her life, and Colin Firth (as Daphne\'s father, Henry Dashwood) is a revelation here, in that he literally becomes more and more attractive as the tale unfolds - as he becomes more and more who he really is underneath his repressed exterior (the scene where he dons his black leather pants and prances in front of the mirror to the horror of his prim prude of a fiancee is priceless), and Oliver James as musician Ian, Daphne\'s love interest, makes a memorable splash here as well. Everyone else is perfect in their roles too (even the dog rocks). \nThe screenplay and direction: completely on the mark.  Never gets heavy-handed, contrived, mean-spirited, cloying or tedious, believe it or not.  The charm is sustained throughout in a dazzling balance of comedy, heartfelt emotion, conflict and growth, culminating in one of the most satisfying resolutions I\'ve experienced in a movie in a long time.Occasionally, a movie can have predictable elements without that being a bad thing; sometimes predictable elements can be pleasurable -- you realize what\'s going to happen but you also realize you\'re in such capable hands that you actually anticipate the playing-out of the scenes you know will occur.  Sometimes it\'s not WHAT is done in a movie but HOW it\'s achieved, and WHO is doing the achieving.', 'This review written in late 2013 at a time when Ms. Bynes career seems to have derailed and we wish her the best. In her career to date, the two most accomplished works she has left for us are this film, WHAT A GIRL WANTS, and the work she did a few years later, SHES THE MAN. Will deal with the latter first. SHES THE MAN is one of a small sub-sub-sub class of Hollywood products that attempts to build a movie around the notion of a woman disguised as man. There are at least a dozen of these floating around the IMDb. The writing in SHES THE MAN is way above average, and the supporting cast is perfect. But it is Bynes who steals the show there, possibly doing the most impressive male-female switch in film history. And speaking of stealing the show, that is exactly what she does in WHAT A GIRL WANTS. (The title never seemed a good match to the actual film, which builds slowly and successfully to a satisfying conclusion). Playing opposite a stellar cast (Colin Firth? Wow!) Bynes provided the perfect mix of energy, youth and charm to move this movie into a class of its own. She ""owns"" the role and once you have seen the film, it is hard to imagine anyone else doing it.', ""Okay, I love this movie. It's sweet, it's simple, it's cute, and fun. It's clever and well put together. The scenery is great (what's not to love about London)? And Firth and Bynes were adorable. Colin Firth is great no matter what movie he's in, but Amanda Bynes (I've been a fan of hers since she was on Nickelodeon) was fun to watch and a perfect fit for the role of fun-loving Daphne. The rest of the cast was good as well, I loved the jokes that were thrown in and the silly/cute subplots going on (Peach and Pear). I appreciated that this movie didn't take itself too seriously, yet was certainly not all fluff or nonsense, either. I loved how this movie primarily dealt with a father-daughter relationship (so refreshing from other so-called teen movies that often only deal with a teenage romance) and I also loved how the main character, Daphne, was not angry or angsty, she was refreshingly fun and optimistic. Overall this is a good, clean fun movie that can be appreciated by all ages and audiences."", 'I have to say from all the movies that I have watched in the last few weeks with Colin Firth since I recently became enamored of his talent in the A&E production of ""Pride and Prejudice,"" this movie is perhaps the best one that I have seen.It has all the elements of a good movie and Firth at his best. I love the characters and relationships and how they interact with each other. Daphne (Amanda Bynes) is perfect as the teenage daughter searching for the other half of her being and life and finding her father. Her cute little smile and perky American approach no matter what is happening to her portrays her ""can do"" attitude and determination in being herself.And I just have to say that this is Colin Firth in his element! He is fantastic as the Henry Dashwood character (hmmm . . . name seems Austen-ly familiar, don\'t it?) who suddenly finds out he is a father after 17 years. He is tender and sweet and unsure. Probably one of the best scenes ever in the film is during the ""midnight snack"" of Coco Pops in the kitchen where he learns that his wife didn\'t leave him for another man and had always been his even after all the years between. The emotions and thoughts rush over his face as if he is speaking them out loud and the viewer can see his internal struggle to remain calm with the overwhelming feeling of the bitterness he had experienced for all those years.There are so many perfect and good scenes in this movie with very little bloopers that it really can touch a viewer\'s heart. The areas especially with Henry and his daughter are extremely special.The last part of the film is symbolic when Henry Dashwood has a heart-to-heart with his mother, withdraws his candidacy, hits the man who had affected his life so extremely, and then walks into the bright sunlight with a deep breath. The viewer realizes that it is more than just being outside in the sunlight but that he finally came out of the dark after so many long years. He has finally found who he is and what he wants to do.Firth basically took my breath away. With the subsequent scene of him winning back his daughter and then his wife, the viewer has realized that this is one of those pictures that are forthrightly, just a deliciously good picture. This is one that makes you believe in old-fashioned love and fairy tales which seems to be so non-existent in today\'s film making industry.Firth has tremendous talent in saying something extremely vital by NOT saying something. Each scene where he was having discussions with Libby (Kelly Preston) either on the phone or in person, the viewer could read both characters thoughts and feelings and the amazing chemistry that existed after all that time apart.It was also better for the plot to have this international relationship struggle. If it had been in America \x96 especially these days \x96 the press would have made a big deal out of the girl\'s ""native"" upbringing but it probably would not have affected the father\'s political life.Everyone excelled in this movie and kudos to the director and screen writer for bringing such a sweet story to light.One last word is that no review of this movie can be complete without discussing the amazingly hilarious scene of Firth squeezing into his ""old"" black leather pants and t-shirt \x96 and earring? \x96 and dancing in front of a mirror. Each time that particular part plays, everyone bursts out laughing! He was just perfect! And lastly, Darcy was a gooder but Dashwood beat \'im hands down! Maybe it was because Dashwood can laugh at himself, sees the funny side of things, and chose to come into his own self-discovery of who and what he was and wanted to be.I still love Darcy but in this case, I\'ll take Dashwood!']",15,['Comedy']

Out of all of the mega cast movies of late, this is indeed the weakest of all of them. This movie is meant to be a comedy, but I didn't laugh once or even come remotely close to laughing, the cast, some if which are rather talented never get a chance to prove themselves as every scene is so ridiculously short, and the script, talk about a cheese overload, and this is written by Shauna Cross, who wrote a terrifically funny script for Whip It, it's a shame none of the heart, wit and humor that was in that could transfer to this film.The one saving grace this film has is the always wonderful Anna Kendrick, her character is the only one worth mentioning, and one particular scene of hers nearly brought me to tears, she's honestly the only person to stand out in this movie, in fact the storyline between Anna and Chace Crawford would probably make a good film on it's own, without having to compete for screen time with 4 other plot lines, I'm sure Anna's next movie will leave this as a distant memory.Honestly I just can't even explain how silly this movie is, it's best to just see it and surely you will see for yourself. Just wait for the DVD, giving birth is probably less painful than watching this. Mega thumbs down."", ""Even though I only managed to watch about 70% of this movie before turning it off, it still managed to make me feel as though my IQ dropped several points merely by watching an hour of it. All the funniest scenes were shown in the trailer, which is how we were convinced to watch it. Even the brilliant comedic capabilities of Chris Rock fell flat with this flick's horrendous writing. All the jokes were targeted at the intelligence level of dense teenagers, yet the subject matter was for those more mature. And whoever they hired to establish the mood of each scene with lighting must have come fresh off the daily soap opera boat. Every scene was over-lit and flat in appearance. This movie was a beginning-to-end failure."", 'What to Expect When Your Expecting is one of those movies that is too clever to be funny---too boring to be interesting and too bad to be true. It makes me think....directors in Hollywood make one of these because there easy to make, and because they truly believe that the average I.Q. of Rom.Com.(is this a Rom.Com. ??) fans is between 95 and 99. The jokes ?? would be unacceptable in ANY Sienfeld episode. Most of the acting is not what you will be expecting....its self conscious and embarrassing. The performances of Chris Rock and Dennis Quaid save this from being completely disastrous. This is a movie you watch when you ----need to cut the grass. Its a film that dating couples will go to see....and feel....O.K. about it. Infatuation is a strange thing.', ""'WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN YOU'RE EXPECTING': One Star (Out of Five) A so-called comedy about several couples going through the ups and downs of childbirth. The movie features an ensemble cast of different celebrities including Cameron Diaz, Jennifer Lopez, Elizabeth Banks, Anna Kendrick, Brooklyn Decker, Chace Crawford, Matthew Morrison, Rodrigo Santoro, Ben Falcone, Chris Rock and Dennis Quaid. It was directed by Kirk Jones (who's directed much better movies like 'EVERYBODY'S FINE' and 'WAKING NED DEVINE') and written by Heather Hach and Shauna Cross (who wrote the much better 'WHIP IT' as well as the novel it was based on). This film is based on the pregnancy guide (of the same name) by Heidi Murkoff. The movie is no guide to pregnancy and is insulting to the miracle of child birth and anyone involved with it.The story revolves around five couples all expecting a child that sometimes intersect with each other. Diaz plays a TV fitness guru who's expecting a child with a TV dance star (Morrison). Lopez plays a photographer who's planning to adopt a child in Ethiopia with her skeptic husband (Santoro). Banks plays an author on pregnancy who gets a taste of her own medicine while her husband (Falcone) has to deal with his cocky father (Quaid), who's expecting twins with his much younger wife (Decker). Kendrick plays an unexpecting mother coping with romantic issues with the unexpecting father (Crawford) and Rock provides comic relief as the leader of a group of male bonding fathers.Just about everything in the movie is poorly handled and painful to watch. The directing is lackluster and like I said Kirk Jones has shown some directing skills with previous movies but not at all here. I also expected much more from a script penned (at least partially) by Shauna Cross. 'WHIP IT' had so much more genuine heart and honest laughs. All the emotion and humor here is completely forced. The acting for the most part is atrocious; I've come to expect very little from Diaz and Lopez but Banks usually does much better work. She does probably give the best performance of the film though and is the only one who comes across as a believable expecting mother. The main problem with the film is how unrealistic and insulting it is not only to women but to anyone who watches it. A lot of the humor relies on jokes about a mother that feels no pain and always looks perfect and stunningly beautiful and a kid who's constantly put in danger and hurting himself. The comedy is in astonishingly bad taste. Rock does give a few good laughs (along with Thomas Lennon, Rob Huebel and Amir Talai as the male bonding dads) but just a few.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olADa6vEcMk"", 'You can still have a good time watching it, especially if you\'re more open minded and go in expecting nothing I suppose. But situations happening in the movie are not really depicted that funny. When people talk about ""timing"" or rather bad timing, they could use this as an example of how it doesn\'t work.Looking at the talent at work you do wonder, but it is possible. I really enjoyed movies like New Years Eve, Valentines Day, even though they were shallow too. But they were still sweet in a good sense. Most of this movie just doesn\'t work. One of the few things that almost worked, was Brooklyn Deckers character. She brought some sass into it. But even her character falls apart most of the time. Cameron Diaz might be as unfunny as she can get, same goes for Elizabeth Banks.Only woman who almost saves this mess entirely is Anna Kendrick. But even her character goes from hi-to-low in a split second, making you shake your head so hard in disbelief, that it might actually fall off. And her characters resolution ... don\'t get me started on that.So while the movie tries very hard to be sweet (and partly achieves it), it is more annoying than anything else. I am a sucker for movie that are going in that direction, but they have to deserve it too, and this movie just doesn\'t.', ""What can I say about this comedy the creators clearly didn't care about? Well it exists.. Its generic.. It has celebrities that were considered the top of their game and attractive 10+ years ago? Other than that there really isn't much to say about the characters in this movie. Everyone does things and to be honest i had to slap myself in the face a couple times to even stay awake during its runtime. Which clocks in at about 110 minutes but feels like 4 hours. Is it the worst generic comedy filled with female celebrities past their prime that I've seen? No, but its somewhere in the middle. Its pretty ironic that the best acting in this movie comes from the person i hate the most. Jenny on the block actually displays some rather nice scenes and is way easier to relate to than any of the other actresses. Would i ever recommend this movie to anyone? No, but if your valium bottle is empty and when it comes out on video you might as well rent it to help you through a warm summer night of insomnia."", 'Contrarily to this adapted verbose title, one shouldn\'t \'expect\' much that is, unless literary desecration is in your hand of cards--if that is the game you\'re looking to play, then consider this mess a winner.Inspired by Heidi Murkoff\'s multimillion-selling-self-help-book for expectant mothers--holding the same name--\'What to Expect\', the film, will be much less prolific. Obviously a lot more work, and money, towards getting an ensemble cast--as opposed to garnering producers with emphasis on purpose and ingenuity--the filmmakers, here, create a product that is not the least bit unique it\'s a generic label laden with followed genre-specific clichés, bawdy humor, and disjointed direction.Despite its few laughs, known cast, and affecting hints towards pregnancy, \'What to Expect\' is an over-packed piece of ""luggage"" that becomes too frustrating to haul around. An immersion too tediously futile and not nearly enough funny. Expect worse...', 'If you have been through the experience of giving birth or simply becoming a father you will probably be able to relate to the story. Not that it wouldn\'t give an idea for those who don\'t belong in the circle, but it certainly makes more sense when you know exactly what they are talking about. ""What to Expect When You\'re Expecting"" is supposed to be a comedy about babies and the challenges they come with. But watching all those couples and their struggles makes it just as hard. Yes, in my opinion, they are not so funny as expected. The situations are meant to make you laugh, but they didn\'t quite have my vote. The story is very simple and the cast is full of familiar faces, but I still missed the right atmosphere until we got to the end. Elizabeth Banks was lucky to get the best parts and if weren\'t for the emotional end, I wouldn\'t hesitate to lower my score just a tad. Maybe you should see this one for yourself.', ""Well... don't expect much. The plot is thin, predictable and the movie is simply not funny. My girlfriend roped me in -- so I went. The cast was likable... but everything else about the movie I couldn't bear. That said, this is a sure fire girl film that your lady love... especially if she has baby on her mind. The cast is very easy on the eyes.. especially the gorgeous Brooklyn Decker who is certainly bound to a be a big star. Jennifer Lopez was not very good or funny. My favorite characters in the film were Chris Rock and Anna Kendrick who are always funny and spot on in their roles. Great date film... but GUYS, beware -- you are in for a tedious night."", 'I was expecting to come away with a sassy name for this new genre, the Hollywood-ensemble rom-com, but there was nothing clever to provide any inspiration in ""What to Expect When You\'re Expecting"". The best line that I have heard to describe this comes from a fellow IMDb user, gregeichelberger, ""It\'s ""New Year\'s Eve"" in the neo-natal unit; ""Valentine\'s Day"" with a uterus; ""Knocked Up"" times five."" That sums up the whole thing perfectly.The Hollywood ensemble is this frustrating trend to load the movie with as many stars as possible, so you have only floating heads and no actual characters. Surprisingly, one of the worst offenders is the similarly-themed indie dramedy ""Conception"" (2010) where we get to follow 9 (yes, 9!) different couples. This movie isn\'t as bad, there are only 5 main couples.The intertwining of them is very limited. The four other girls basically all watch Jules (Cameron Diaz) on her reality TV shows. The timing, on the other hand, is all in sync. They get pregnant at the same time, start showing at the same time, and give birth at the same time. The point is of course that you don\'t know what to expect since each girl\'s pregnancy is different and experiences it differently.Jules is going to control it – whether her partner tags along or not; Holly (Jennifer Lopez) is going to lie her way through adoption if that\'s what it takes; Wendy (Elizabeth Banks) wants the joy but gets the worst; Skyler (Brooklyn Decker) is going to make it perfect, just like herself; Rosie (Anna Kendrick) doesn\'t know what she\'s going to do. If the movie had left it at that, it would have been cute, romantic, funny and heartfelt, and possibly empowering.But then they introduced ""the dude pack"" which is even worse than it sounds. They are a group of fathers, led by Chris Rock, who are given the stupidest sounding lines to try and make funny. It was painful how unfunny it was. Imagine if you will, a Hollywood writer being paid to come up with never-before-said lines to turn into popular catch-phrases. The way ""Horrible Bosses"" was almost successful (but ultimately not) with Sudeikis\' ""I would like to bend her over a barrel and show her the fifty states"". That was exactly the case with the ""comedy"" in this movie. All of their lines were met with a few unimpressed question marks on faces but never any laughs.However, the mothers-to-be were pretty good. Some were on the boring side, but two were able to deliver enough humour and heart to almost make up for the entirety of ""What to Expect When You\'re Expecting"". I don\'t know what it is about Anna Kendrick but she makes my heart melt every time she\'s on the screen. Extremely cute, in a relatable kind of way, and able to hold our hearts, she was the one that got us through this movie. Elizabeth Banks was able to go as over-the-top as only pregnant movie heroines are allowed to and gave it her all to deliver the comedy of what not to expect. Of course, it wasn\'t quite enough because we do know exactly what to expect.', 'You know what I expect? I expect better movies! ""What to Expect When You\'re Expecting"" is once again another ensemble rom-com that\'s basically just a bunch of short stories glued together in a full-length motion picture. You know, with a cast like this, this movie would have been better off with a title like ""What to Expect When You\'re \'Selling Out\'"". I wouldn\'t say that this movie was ""god-awful"", I suppose that maybe a married couple might enjoy something here, but this is still an unoriginal, predictable, and unmemorable piece of ""nothing"". Director Kirk Jones has provided to give us a giant predictable ""sell-out"" that does nothing but go with the usual clichés. In movies like this, we usually get a bunch of individual stories packed in one movie, some that we care about, and some that we don\'t care about. Each story talks about a group of couples who are about to either have a baby, adopt a baby, or deciding whether to have the baby or not. We\'ve seen these stories plenty of times before, so there\'s already a clue for the audience to know what will happen next. There are some chuckle-inducing moments, and I cared for a few story lines, but it\'s just a shame because there are so many likable actors in this movie, so this might be considered as a waste of talent. Cameron Diaz plays a weight loss contestant on a reality show who\'s expecting a newborn with Matthew Morrison, Jennifer Lopez takes the ""Angelina Jolie"" perspective to adopt an African baby, Elizabeth Banks plays a pregnant woman with tons of anxiety problems on the torture of pregnancy, and what do you know, Chris Rock is actually the leader of a group of ""baby daddies"". These story lines are probably careless, and mostly not funny, if you ask me! The only two story lines I actually enjoyed involves Anna Kendrick as a young woman who is expecting a baby after a certain one-night stand, and Dennis Quaid as a NASCAR legend who\'s expecting a new baby with his much younger, and ridiculously hot wife, played by Brooklyn Decker. I actually need to score this movie some points for that! But either way, I wasn\'t surprised! This movie is exactly what everyone thought it was going to be, so I guess I can say I\'m not really that upset with this movie. But ""What to Expect When You\'re Expecting"" is not worth watching in any way, but if you\'re the type of person who enjoys these type of movies, my advice to you...wait for rental! I didn\'t expect that remark to pop out of my mouth. ""What to Expect When You\'re Expecting"", in my review, ""predictable and mediocre, but overall unimpressive"".', 'I\'m usually pretty good at weeding out the films that put all the best scenes in the trailer then leave you with a bunch of junk when you actually sit through it in its entirety. But I must admit I was fooled with this one. The daddy\'s group shown in the previews led me to believe this would be an edgy hilarious take on pregnancy. Considering Chris Rock was featured heavily in the clips, I thought it would be a safe bet. Unfortunately Chris Rock\'s "" Dudes group"" has minimal screen time, and even when they are on screen, the material is just not funny. If you\'ve seen the trailer, you\'ve seen the best this movie has to offer.I guess the producers thought they had a huge summer blockbuster on their hands; I mean why else would they pay top dollar for so many A-list actors all in one film if they didn\'t believe the film would be successful enough to see a return on their investments? It really does baffle me because this film is nowhere near as good as it should be to warrant the hefty paychecks of this cast.The film centers around a montage of female characters from early pregnancy to delivery (with the exception of Jennifer Lopez, she\'s looking to adopt). There\'s a young 20-something who hardly knows her beau at all, a woman who\'s been looking forward to conceiving with relish but finds the reality of it a rather unpleasant surprise, her younger mother-in-law who, annoyingly, seems to handle her pregnancy with hardly a glitch, and a fitness guru who thinks she can control the whole ordeal like she does her diet and exercise regimen.Ironically, as a stand alone, any one of these couples stories could have been developed into a decent film. However the mingling of all these stories results in a shallow treatment that makes the film underwhelming. And while this wouldn\'t necessarily make or break it, add in the fact that the film is just not funny enough, and it\'s just a waste. Some genuine humor would have made the flaws forgivable. Consider this: The only funny scene of the film is about 20 seconds in duration, containing non-main characters who have about 10 minutes total screen time. Wendi McLendon-Covery (of Bridesmaids) and Thomas Lennon share the single funny scene in the film and they\'re hardly in the movie, which means.......you get the point.Overall there is some potential with this film, it\'s just underdeveloped and badly written. I wouldn\'t pay to see it, but it\'s good way to while away a couple hours if you happen to catch it on TV. Other than that, steer clear. This coming from a chick who enjoys rom coms. Thumbs down.', ""What to Expect When You're Expecting (2012) Director: Kirk Jones. Cast: Cameron Diaz, Jennifer Lopez, Elizabeth Banks, Chace Crawford, Anna Kendrick, Matthew Morrison, Dennis Quaid, Chris Rock.Don't ask me what possessed me to go and watch this film. In my defence I can tell you that I had seen everything else at my local multiplex and I had 2 hours to spare. Also the cast seemed impressive enough... and, to top it all up, my wife is pregnant, so I thought at least I would fit its target audience just perfectly.To be completely honest I was expecting (sorry about the pun) something a lot worse: this is one of those average ensemble comedies where, as always some of the stories and some of the characters are more successful than others but in the end they are so many of them that if you are a parent or preparing to be one, you're bound to find a something to like... Other than that, this is all pure middle-class Hollywood, pretty slick, light-hearted but with enough sweet-and-sour moments to make it feel like it's actually about something. Obviously at the end of the day it's all rather forgettable, and it's actually a great shame, because the acting talent a shown here is impressive (surprisingly even Jennifer Lopez showcases a nuanced performance unlike much we'd seen before) both directing and editing are potentially quite skilled at doing what they do and the few good moments here and there give you a little glimpse of what it could have been.The main problem is that the film is just not funny enough to be able to be a crowd pleaser and looses itself among the too many subplots, some of which are way off the main subject, to be able to become a classic (the golf cart chase sequence is one of the lowest and unfunny points and the father group sequences, despite Chris Rock, are just too indulgent, over the top and long). However having said all this, I must confess, even though I laughed very little, I found myself moved a couple of times: oh dear, it really must be the hormones (I think they call it sympathetic pregnancy).6/10 wp.me/p19wJ2-yv"", ""I'm a mom of 4..I thought it was hilarious at times. I don't think anyone can appreciate this movie if they don't have kids. Its a movie people! It kept my interest. I like the fact it mixed good w bad..happy and sad.

With some other movies not interesting her, it was between The Lucky Ones and this one, both movies that have a low score on IMDb. I was pleasantly surprised, however, with not just the actors in the movie but also with the dialogue and chemistry on screen, which seemed very natural. I definitely enjoyed watching it and will most likely end up buying it on DVD; not even the fact that Chris Rock was in it bothered me, whereas I usually can't stand him. I have to applaud Jennifer Lopez too, I never thought much of her as an actress, but I found myself sympathizing with her and liking her portrayal of the character. Over all, I find that this movie deserves a higher score than it's currently got on IMDb."", ""Director Kirk Jones (liked his other movie too, Everybody's fine) did a good job again directing a simple and well known concept pertaining to the process of pregnancy and child birth : takes a man and a woman to bring a baby into this world. This movie is mainly about how every woman and man go through the tribulations of this aspect of life's journey differently. Cameron Diaz as Jules , fitness guru ( a la Jillian Michaels of Biggest loser) is in great shape and is happy to be impregnated by Evan (matthew Morrison). Elizabeth banks,Wendy, encourages people to breastfeed babies and goes through a very tough pregnancy and has full support from her husband Gary ( Ben Falcone from Bridesmaids and TV shows: Yes, dear and Curb your enthusiasm). Brooklyn Decker as the young wife of Dennis Quaid( father of Gary) is very naturally young and has a very easy twin pregnancy. Anna Kendrick(Rosie) loses her baby , pregnant after just one night stand with Marco (Chace Crawford). Rosie and Marco are sad after losing baby. Rosie has a very positive attitude and has confidence that because she is young she will definitely have many more chances at pregnancy. On the other hand, Jennifer Lopez as Holly is ready for adopting Ethiopian baby after going through several attempts at making babies in different ways. She feels miserable after losing contract as a photographer and feels like a loser. All the actors did well. I enjoyed watching Elizabeth banks and Brooklyn Decker(Just go with it) the most. I like Kendrick and she does well in any role (Up in the air, 50/50). Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Lopez did well. Among the male actors ,Ben Falcone was convincing as a very supportive husband of Banks. I felt the slap when Banks slapped Falcone demanding pain medications during labor.... Pregnancies are tough. No wonder Mother's day and father's day are special...."", 'What to Expect When You\'re Expecting was inspired by the New York Times bestseller with the same title. While the book is a guide to help women understand what to expect during pregnancy, the movie is a hilarious and heartwarming comedy. The movie follows five couples whose lives are dramatically changed by the challenges of preparing for parenthood. This movie boasts an ensemble cast, which doesn\'t always equate to box office success. Keep reading to find out what you can expect from What to Expect When You\'re Expecting.Author of a new children\'s book and baby store owner Wendy (Elizabeth Banks), gets a big dose of her own overbearing advice when pregnancy hormones overwhelm her body. Wendy\'s husband Gary (Ben Falcone) struggles in his own way. Gary has a super competitive alpha-male father (Dennis Quaid), who\'s expecting twins with his new trophy wife, Skyler (Brooklyn Decker). Holly (Jennifer Lopez) is a photographer who is prepared to traverse the planet to adopt a child. Her husband Alex (Rodrigo Santoro) is not quite sure about the whole thing. So, Holly tells Alex to join a ""dude\'s support group"". The support group brings us Vic (Chris Rock), who leads the ""dude"" pack and preaches about the woes of parenthood. Jules (Cameron Diaz) is a fitness guru who is absolutely crazy about starting a family. After appearing on a reality dance show with Evan (Matthew Morrison), the dance pair realizes they are going to be parents. Their high intensity celebrity lifestyles don\'t stand a chance against the demands of pregnancy. Enjoy the ride as they try to continue with their lives as if the baby isn\'t going to slow them down. Rosie (Anna Kendrick) and Marco (Chase Crawford) have the typical on again/off again relationship, which many viewers will relate to these days. Many other stars have smaller roles, but are equally important to the overall success of this film.With so many story lines and mini-plots going on you have to wonder if audiences will be able to keep up with everything that takes place throughout the course of the movie. Some might consider this film simple and predictable, but it\'s really more of a light-hearted, feel good flick. There are moments throughout the film, which may tug at your heartstrings. There are other moments when the entire audience will erupt in laughter. This movie takes you on an emotional roller-coaster ride with more ups than downs. The ride ends as you walk out of the theater with a smile on your face.Kirk Jones was sitting in the Director\'s chair for this roller-coaster ride. His recent films include Nannie McPhee and Everybody\'s Fine (Writer/Director). While Kirk only has a handful of major motion pictures under his belt, he does an excellent job with the script. There are so many moving parts to this movie, including several different locations and multiple plot lines. It\'s admirable that he was able to pull them all together. He also had a large number of talented actors to keep happy and headed in the right direction. Kudos to Kirk Jones for a job well done.The screenplay was written by Shauna Cross and Heather Hach. Both writers only have a couple of major screenplay credits to their name, which is surprising given the complexity, depth and calamity which was all infused into What to Expect When You\'re Expecting. If you watch any reality TV at all you will pick up on a number of references throughout the film. Jules (Cameron Diaz) is an obvious spoof on Jillian Michaels from NBC\'s The Biggest Loser. There are a number of other obvious and very funny references as well. Shauna and Heather definitely have bright futures ahead of them in Hollywood.What to Expect When You\'re Expecting masterfully interweaves several story lines of couples expecting children and bundles it all up with a heavy dose of laughter. If you have seen the trailer for the movie, you might have wondered if the trailer is funnier than the movie. Thankfully that is not the case\x85this movie is very enjoyable. It is loaded with laughter, warmth, depth and dialogue that will appeal to both men and women alike. Guys, if you are dreading the thought of seeing this movie\x85have no fear, this movie is worth the trip.

I thought it would be along the lines of those star-studded movies that don't really work because they have too much talent in them i.e. Valentines Day and New Years Eve. However, I was very pleasantly surprised.Is it predictable? Yes. Is it obvious? Yes. But it's also funny and heartfelt, and I for one thoroughly enjoyed it.I have heard a lot of criticism regarding the movie being unrealistic, in particular that pregnancy was not accurately portrayed. I respectfully disagree. The writers did well covering a range of situations - from an older woman in the limelight having a baby to a young girl with an unplanned pregnancy, it seems to me the writers went out of their way to ensure they covered every possible situation they could in two hours.My husband and I both laughed out loud a lot, and I didn't mind going to bed extra late on a Thursday when I have to get up early to see this movie. In fact, I felt the lack of sleep was worth it.Don't pick holes in it, just go and enjoy what's in front of you."", '""I just wanted the glow. The one that they promise you on the cover of those magazines. Well, I\'m calling it - pregnancy sucks. Making a human being is really hard. I have no control over my body or my emotions."" This is a movie based off the famous book and deals with five different couples and how they handle pregnancy ranging from problems trying to adopt to having a sickeningly easy time giving birth. This is yet another movie dealing with many different couples and relationship problems but this is one of the better ones. I have said before that I am not really a fan of this type of genre but I really enjoyed this movie and laughed throughout. It may be because I have a kid and went through the whole pregnancy thing with my wife but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. I am also really shocked at my favorite movies of the last few weeks. I have really enjoyed ""Think Like A Man"" and ""Five-Year Engagement"" and once again I think this ""chick-flick"" is the best movie of the week. I am not sure what that says about me but there are some really funny parts in this and if you are a woman do not be afraid about bringing this home to your man, he may throw a fit at first but the comedy (and Cameron Diaz\'s opening dance scene) will keep him watching and he will also enjoy it. I know I did...the dance was amazing though. Overall, a surprisingly funny movie that really won me over and I thought that was great. I (again surprisingly) give this an A.', ""I love this movie. Maybe it is because I am female and just recently had my first born, but this movie hits home with me. It is funny and very honest about some of the displeasentries of pregnancy. But it is also heartfelt and very sweet. Chris Rock is hilarious. J-Lo was very bland for me, and the baby she got? No way was that baby 6 weeks, or anywhere near. But this is normal to use older babies because the younger ones don't handle production lighting very well, or at least this is the reasoning I have heard. Either way. Seriously is a wonderful movie. But don't make your man watch it. It is the essence of a chick flick. Really, I don't think it is fair that men are even rating this movie because it will never be a hit for them... actually, though, my husband was okay with it. Simply because he was recently in the same boat, wide-eyed and scared something-less about becoming a daddy and all the trials and tribulations of pregnancy and child birth. So maybe for soon to be or recent daddies, but not for other me. Just like I am not interested in Jarhead, they will not be interested in this. Sorry, guys... but please quit damaging the ratings on a movie that truly is wonderful, but simply has no chance to make it with you. Not fair. Ladies- watch this with your friends, be prepared for a few tears at the end, and make sure to scare your first-time mamma's to be with it! LoL."", ""I don't know why this has so few stars. It should have a ten star rating. The movie is filled with great comedy. It has the actor from Glee, who's awesome. J-Lo. Cameron Diaz. Dennis Quaid. Come on! These are excellent actors.

The subject matter comes at the perfect time. Bridesmaids was last year, this year it's babies!! So, why not watch it? It seems the box office didn't agree with me, but this is one with laughs all the way through. Every actor has the perfect part. They do such a great job portraying these parents-to-be.

I don't want to know what will happen in the end. I just don't care.Secondly I did not find anything funny. Now comedy is a matter of taste and the people i watched this with laughed out loud.

I just saw this movie for the first time, and I gotta say, Woody Allen should be getting royalty checks.  I\'m stunned how many Allen trademarks were ""borrowed"" for this film (starting with neurotic Jewish male / flakey Shiksa princess romance all the way on down to the use of ""It Had To Be You"" -- ANNIE HALL\'s theme song).  I can just imagine the pitch meeting:  ""It\'s like ANNIE HALL, only re-imagined by Neil Simon as a sitcom pilot!""  I mean, it\'s a sweet movie, but I think its classic status is way overscaled. Plus, the notorious fake orgasm scene was rather, uh, anticlimactic.  It was so over-the-top (anyone really behaving like that in a public NY establishment would be escorted out immediately), it felt more like an SNL sketch than a romantic comedy.', 'I give this movie 1 out of ten.  The one mark for the resturaunt scene. This movie was appaling for an actor with the abillities ofBilly Crystal.Superb for one with the abillities of Meg Ryan.', ""It isn't exactly love at first sight: Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan share a car from Chicago to New York, and after a decade of chance encounters finally become close friends. But by mutual consent the two are determined not to sleep together, thinking that a commitment between lovers would somehow jeopardize the casual rapport they otherwise enjoy. Will they or won't they? It's a ridiculous argument at any rate: men and women can of course be just friends, but there's no reason for this couple to prove the point, since both are young, single, compatible, obviously attracted to each other, and have no luck with other partners. Nora Ephron's overwritten screenplay benefits from two stars with plenty of chemistry, playing characters with very little appeal: Harry is smug; Sally is cuddly; and neither is able to define him- or herself outside of a sexual relationship. Meg Ryan fakes a good orgasm, and the film in general does an even more convincing imitation of 'Annie Hall', to a point where it could easily suffer from charges of plagiarism."", ""The relationship between the title characters is explored over the course of a dozen years. This treads the same ground that Woody Allen's romantic comedies have been exploring for decades except that this feels like one of his lesser efforts because Reiner is not in the same league as Allen. This is an uninspired, by-the-numbers exercise that is fondly remembered by audiences primarily for its single funny scene - the fake orgasm by Ryan at a deli. Unfortunately, everything else about this witless comedy also seems fake, including the emotions and the relationships. The intermittent interviews with the couples is meant to be touching, but comes across as pathetically contrived."", 'After having received very positive comments from a friend I had tried for years to find a copy of a film, but in vain. Now that the film was at last shown on TV, I set out to watch the film with great expectations.The beginning of the film was very promising. The University of Chicago was familiar, as I had visited the place even myself, but after that there was only one scene which made me burst into laughter, i.e., the scene where Sally had an orgasm in a restaurant and another customer wanted to have the same (dish) as her.Sally was pretty to watch. Acting was fine, but the story was so American. In one word, the film was rubbish.', 'Nora Ephron\'s original screenplay for ""When Harry Met Sally..."" often doesn\'t feel original at all. Her acerbic insights are wrapped up in Woody Allen-isms, while director Rob Reiner lays on the autumnal romanticism of a dozen other movies. Still, it\'s an enjoyable picture, with at least one line (delivered by Reiner\'s real-life mother) that still brings down the house. Single man and woman (he the chauvinistic one, she both headstrong and insecure) are thrown together for a one-time car trip, which leads to numerous such meetings in which both characters constantly square off against the other for their respective sexes. Ephron\'s world isn\'t peopled with living, breathing human beings ; she\'s interested in clever sound-bites and lyrical humdingers--anything to get a smile out of the audience. Reiner handles stars Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan very well, and his chapter stops involving various married couples, done pseudo-documentary style, is cute in a winking, Hollywood way. Still, while the public was tickled and critics were entertained, nobody thought this was great filmmaking, resulting in one Oscar nomination for Ephron. **1/2 from ****', 'I decided to watch this for the first time and thought it was one of the most realistic romance movies that there is.

The scene where Sally tells Harry how easy it is for a woman to fake an orgasm and then, demonstrates it in the restaurant is straight classic!! That part alone, is worth watching the movie. On a whole, it's a cute story about falling in love, and finding love where you least expect it. The principle characters Harry (Billy Crystal) & Sally (Meg Ryan) find their paths keep crossing after a chance meeting while driving to New York. They try to set their friends up with each other, before realizing that they are the ones who are meant for each other. A cute film."", ""Can you beat some of the lines in this film? As a guy, which I am, I identified with Harry's lines so much, and you can't help but side with him. The chemistry between the two actors, Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan is superb, and you believe in them when they talk, you feel for them when they look at each other. Even the friends are well casted, Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby. It's such relaxed acting and filming that you do nothing but watch these people fall in love, and pretty soon you feel like you're involved as well. With a fantastic soundtrack, direction, script and acting, it's a great film."", ""This is Billy Crystal's show.  He has an understated, ordinary, humble screen presence.  It's not the case that every single line HAS to be funny in order for us to like him - with Crystal, a joke can fall flat and somehow it doesn't make him personally look bad.  But here every line IS funny, so he has charm to burn.I know people like Meg Ryan - I guess I do, too, in this particular film - and I know that there are people who find her `orgasm' scene amusing, but Sally is really just someone for Harry to meet and ultimately fall in love with.  She's completely clueless.  Most of the jokes are at her expense rather than his.  The genuine wit, the power of observation, the theoretical insight, all lie with Harry.  Is this a problem?  Not in the least.  Unlike most romantic comedies this is not some kind of duel - it's the more realistic study of many, many separate encounters.Also unlike most romantic comedies, this one is funny.  I think I mentioned that.The film benefits from its second rank support: good performances by Carrie Fischer and that guy whose name doesn't matter, locations someone actually went to some trouble to look for, and a song-score that is doesn't intrude and hit us repeatedly over the head.  Allegedly `When Harry Met Sally' has been imitated by later productions, but I can't think of a case where the imitation is accurate enough to even be recognisable."", 'Aside from freer language and more explicitly sexual humour, When Harry met Sally is a very traditional romantic comedy, very much in the mould established in 1934 by It Happened One Night. Two very different but evenly-matched people are thrown together by circumstance. They are initially hostile to one another, but over the course of the film, this hostility turns to love as their personalities are softened by exposure to their opposites. Indeed, the central traits of Harry and Sally correspond very directly to those of Peter and Ellen in IHON - he worldly-wise and cynical, she spoiled and certain of what\'s what. Neither of them, it turns out, is as right or as self-confidant as they believe. What\'s very modern about WHMS is its attitude to long-term relationships. It\'s no longer enough for the couple simply to fall in love and live happily ever after. They must have a full and real understanding of exactly what, or who, they\'re letting themselves in for. They must also be sexually compatible (hence the importance of their having slept with one another before they finally get together). Within this framework of traditional romance in an unromantic world, WHMS is almost perfect. Structurally, there are no gaps or implausibilities. Even the central coincidence of these people running into each other under these circumstances is answered. The short but affecting intermissions of successful old couples describing their relationships are not only crucial to the pacing of the film, they also make the point that Harry and Sally are just another couple with an unusual and interesting story. There\'s an element of luck and coincidence in every successful relationship. The effectiveness of the film\'s structure is perhaps best highlighted by the soundtrack. There\'s a perfectly selected Louis Armstrong track for every phase of their relationship - the soundtrack not only complements the mood of the film, it comments on the action. The acting is superb, with the two main protagonists as well as their two foils (Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher) all giving career-best comic performances. Without such fantastic performances, it\'s very possible that the film could have failed: these are essentially self-indulgent people, that we sympathise with them and recognise them is in great measure down to the stars. Finally, the script is fantastic. Of course nobody really speaks like that, but like all great scripts it distills emotions and points of view into a few lines. And it\'s funny. The one-liners are still sharp and amusing on the twentieth viewing, and the set-pieces are beautifully realised (the orgasm scene is only the most famous - check out Harry\'s olympic sex-dream speech - ""Must have been the dismount"" - or the ""I\'m through making a schmuck out of myself"" phone call). All this, and a dinner party talking point about male and female relationships. Can we ever be just friends? Not even with an ugly girl? ""Nah, you pretty much want to nail them too.""', 'What a great movie. The dialogues between Harry and Sally are extremely funny and interesting, they\'re basically everything that I like to think and talk about with my best friend. Who is a guy, and not a girl, a thing that is perfectly explained in the movie by Billy Crystal. Except for the dark side thing his character is somebody I really relate to, we just think alike. Great acting, great music, great dialogues(especially by Crystal who, at moments looks like Jerry Seinfeld;I don\'t know if i\'s those white sneakers or the dialogues:) and a bunch of very funny jokes make this movie a must see for everyone. Oh and a nice touch with those scenes where old married couples explain the (sometimes almost unbelievable) circumstances in which they met.

In this episode of their adventures they are interns in Rome for a `fashion' designer who puts them right into the mailroom to learn what working hard is all about(I guess..).  Besides the typical flirtations with boys there is nothing much else except the Rome scenario until about ¾ way into the movie when it's finally revealed why they are getting fired, then re-hired, then fired again, then re-hired again.  This is definetly made by people who don't understand the corporate world and it shows in their interpretation of it.  Maybe the real world will be their next adventure(if there is one.).

I would like to see them succeed very much as they were a very inspirational pair growing up and I would like to see them grow as people, actresses and in their career as well as their personal life. So producers, please give the girls a chance to develop something that goes off the tangent a bit, move them into a new direction that recognises them individually and their talents in many facets. This movie that is being commented is not too bad, but as I have seen further on in their movies, their movies stay the same of typical plot and typography. When In Rome is good for audiences of younger generation but the adults who were kids when the twins were babies want to follow the twins in their successes and so hence I think we adults would like to see them make movies of different kinds, maybe some that are like the sixth sense, the hour, chocolat, that sort of movie - not saying to have just serious movies for them, humour ones too yes, but rather see them in different roles to what they have been playing in their more recent movies like this one and New York Minute.

Where the Boys Are,2.92,3.17,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance']","Four very different college girls drive to Fort Lauderdale, Florida for spring break and seek out various adventures and romance for themselves.",joy,"['Though far from an intelligent production, this 1984 reworking of the 1960 film is nevertheless a fun time capsule of early-to-mid 1980\'s culture. Forget about plot. This movie is just a mindless and pleasant romp on the beach at Fort Lauderdale before spring breakers were driven out and the monster condos took over the skyline. It features far more location shooting than the original (that one was mostly Hollywood sets) and some interesting 80\'s music. I am biased; I\'m nostalgic for the 80\'s and I love Fort Lauderdale and Florida, so I may enjoy it more than the average viewer.Not every film should be a literary gem as life is more than that. ""Where the Boys Are"" is an honest look at what was going on with the college kids of the time. There is some brief nudity and sexual content that may be mildly distasteful, but that is what was happening in Fort Lauderdale until the late 80\'s and 90\'s saw the city powers-that-be effectively sweep the spring break crowd north to Daytona.Don\'t build up great expectations and you will probably enjoy this otherwise forgettable flick.', ""If anybody remembers this title, then they remember how bad it is. And I don't imagine its aged well. First film of TriStar Pictures, hey, they can't all be winners, and this one, believe it or no, made a little bit of money for the company, considering the budget. So what's this movie about? There's a hot bod contest, and somebody wants to win. Is that it, you ask? HEY, it's Where The Boys Are, its not called Where The Good Movies Are. If you won't have fun in the sun, then you'll just have fun. That, or you'll turn this off 20 minutes in, and find something else to watch. Far cry from the 60's original, this remake is over saturated with beach nudity. Whoever said all movies have to be made with class never watched this one, and maybe they should. 4 out of 10 from me. I'm in a good mood. I'll view this one as nostalgia."", ""I used to watch this movie on VHS at my friend's house after school, in the late eighties. I wish I could find the movie now because I'd definitely buy it. It's a crude beach flick, meant to make you cringe and giggle, and it does it well. The performances are earnest, if not actually good, and you end up actually liking the group of ditzes. The music and the party scenes are enjoyable, in a trashy way, and I love that the rich, upper class characters like Barbara and Camden are so out of place in all the spring break wildness. I mean, who visits their uptight family friends on Spring Break? The plot to this movie is irrelevant, because its fun lies in its brainlessness. Enjoy the half-naked coeds and cheap jokes, because sometimes, that's a beautiful thing."", ""I really feel like this fun sex foursome + 1 hunk comedy has been singled out. There were many others floating about, before or in the after, male or female, where I'm not gonna run down a list. On the contrare, this is one of the better ones. At least it has a story and characters, you involve yourself in, instead of just going for the T and A. By no means, I'm not saying it's a good film, but it wasn't the worst film of 84. May'be it's close, I don't know, but just take in what I've just told you. It's hard to believe this was a remake of a respectable sixties film, but we have to get with the times. You know the story: girls go looking for the three S's, where the setting is Fort Lauderdale, yeah again, you spring breakers. The actresses are quite good, particularly Schall, as a southern belle, and Lisa Hartman, who I have a soft spot for. The girls have their own issues, one falls fall in love, one is to marry, whatever. One line of dialogue, there's a reference to Dickie Gere, when one of the lasses is kissing a blow up doll. I don't know, but I quite enjoyed this one, and there are some some real cheesy, so fake moments, but like I said, I really couldn't understand why this movie has been like, picked on. It's joins those other foursome teen sex comedies, but this is of higher rank. Oh did I mean, Lisa Hartman. You decide. Funny start."", 'If you\'re into Spring Break flicks about Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. in the 1980\'s you\'ll probably enjoy this silly romp. These actors are all a little too ""over-the-hill"" to play college students! Keep an eye on Lorna Luft (she\'s Judy Garland\'s daughter & Liza Minelli\'s half sister) she spends a a lot of time mugging for the camera. She tries very hard to make you believe she\'s a college kid, but looks more like a 30-something housewife who belongs in a station wagon, not a convertible. An attempt to give her a younger appearance with pigtails (in a beach scene) only makes her look retarded, not youthful. Unintentional laughter will take hold of you when Luft\'s character, Carole Singer, enters a ""Hot Bod""(?!) contest & wins second place!!! The soundtrack is good, with the standout tunes ""Seven Day Heaven"" by Shandi, & Lisa Hartman\'s remake of the Connie Francis classic ""Where The Boys Are"".', 'I\'m absolutely astonished at the negative and even erroneous comments people are making about this film. I loved it! For an \'80s teen-sex-beach party type of film, what other film could compare? ""The Beach Girls"" (1982), ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (1982), ""Foreplay"" (1982), ""Goin\' All The Way"" (1982), ""The Last American Virgin"" (1982), ""Porky\'s"" (1982), ""Spring Break"" (1983), ""Screwballs"" (1983), ""Loose Screws"" (1985), ""Summer School"" (1987), ""Hard Bodies"" (1989)? I\'ve seen most of them, and for my taste none of those even come close to having simultaneously such good music, good humor, and good scenery as this one.My favorite scene in this movie is in the intro when the girls first hit the road and the great song ""Hot Nights"" is playing, with nice aerial photography of their convertible zipping along en route to Florida. Lynn-Holly Johnson is one foxy lady! In that (pre-Internet) era when I was just starting to get interested in tracking down films with Lynn-Holly in them, the combination of my having found her by accident in this film, the great music, the aerial photography, and the nice Florida scenery really did it for me. I was thrilled. This became my favorite recent movie for the next several months, and I still haven\'t seen anything in the same genre that compares since then.The music is generally good throughout this whole film, which I can\'t say for the 1960 version or any other teen-sex comedy I\'ve seen. ""Hot Nights"" is by far the best song, but ""Be-Bop-A-Lula,"" ""Slow Down,"" and ""Seven Day Heaven"" are good, too, as are the Rockats songs in general. The inflatable man scene, the drunk driving accident scene, and the mansion party scene are high points of humor. The overall upbeat feel of the film is good, and it looks and feels like it was set in Florida, just as it was supposed to. If its goal was to capture the party atmosphere of spring break in Fort Lauderdale in the \'80s, it succeeded admirably.It\'s hard to compare this film to the original 1960 version because the two versions were set in such different eras that they are almost completely different films. The 1960 version may have been cute in some ways, but it is *so* old-fashioned with its euphemistic talk about ""playing house"" and the girl being traumatized just because she lost her virginity that it\'s painful to even watch at some points. In contrast, this 1984 version has freewheeling drugs, drunken driving, and stripping. Nobody\'s striving to land a husband, and it even has a few topless shots in it. This is a real party movie. To hell with the plot. Who needs a story line in a film like this?It is not true that there are only non-nude bikini shots in this movie: see the Mister Bullhorn part and the Hot Bod Contest part for topless shots. I also think Lorna Luft has a great body, so I don\'t understand the criticisms about her being in the Hot Bod Contest. I also didn\'t notice that the girls looked too old for college, either, since college is full of students of all ages. Also, the criticism that this movie was a ""career stopper"" for Lynn-Holly and others just isn\'t logical since it might only be coincidence that those stars didn\'t go on to make any more significant movies, and other actresses have starred in turkeys and their careers still survived. Also, Lynn-Holly was *not* a Playboy magazine Playmate. She appeared under some bed covers in one photo in the June 1981 issue of Playboy at the time of ""For Your Eyes Only"" (1981), but I believe that\'s all. Therefore I don\'t think many of the criticisms about this film and its actresses are valid or even factual. A deeper criticism might be that most of the humor relies on sex, alcohol, and drugs: the M*A*S*H syndrome. I\'ve watched this film at times when I thought all the humor was funny, and at other times when I thought all the humor fell totally flat, so apparently it depends on your mood and your perception of those topics. In any event, this film definitely captured a freer, more tolerant era, just before the War On Drugs became oppressive, just before the AIDS scare became serious, and before the city of Fort Lauderdale harassed spring breakers nearly out of existence in that city. I never thought I\'d look back on the \'80s with affection, but considering America\'s post-9/11 Zeitgeist, the \'80s are starting to look pretty darned good in comparison.No matter how you look at it, this film definitely deserves a *lot* higher rating than its current 2.5/10. I give it 8/10.']",6,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance']"
While You Were Sleeping,4.17,4.28,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance']",A hopelessly romantic Chicago Transit Authority token collector is mistaken for the fiancée of a coma patient.,sadness,"[""It's amazing to realize how much the rom-com genre has evolved over the last 10 or 15 years. Compare While You Were Sleeping, for instance, with Must Like Dogs. While still hewing to the traditional rom-com plot arc, the latter has subtlety, wit, depth, and a delicate touch. While You Were Sleeping Does not.Everything about this movie is predictable, including Bullock's performance. It's interesting to see the earlier work of someone who's been in the business for over 15 years. In her case (as is the case with the bewilderingly overrated Julia Roberts), Bullock seems to have developed a set of pat reactions early on and not strayed too far from them.The only redeeming feature of this picture is that it's not *completely* insulting to our intelligence. Plus there are some believable, though stock, performances by supporting players. Other than that, it has nothing to offer."", ""I hate romantic comedies, first of all they're not comic at all and secondly you just know that the girl will have her prince at the end. Am I the one to blame? Perhaps but certainly not in the case of this vehicle. Problems enough here... Sandra Bullock looks pretty but she can't act, how else would you explain that she only will be remembered for Speed. Bill Pullman has the same appeal as the role he plays....exactly a carpenter! And then the scenes... First of all do they miss all sense of reality...girl who works in the metro sees a rich advocate who's beaten, he fells on the rails (no signs of any danger to be electrocuted!) and Sandra Bullock pushes him in pure Indiana Jonesstyle on the other side. Well, we saw scenes who were more stupid but at the hospital, some nurse introduces madame Bullock as his financee because otherwise she has no right to visit her prince charming. Don't ask me why but I still decided to watch further, perhaps I was in for torturing myself as the story goes on and on and gets more ridiculous...at the time the poor man is in coma (which is a good thing as Peter Gallagher is one of the most horrifying actors to look at) the family believes it all and poor Sandra becomes part of the family. But not her so called brother in law as he starts investigating if she's the real financee or not and look what happens...Sandra Bullock falls in love with mister Pullman. Okay no further revealing from plots (well if they can be called like that anyway) but the movie gets sillier and boring (and knowing the start was already terrible). This can be perhaps the ultimate movie for desperate women who wanna have their dose of romantic but for chrissakes : get a life...."", 'I found it difficult to identify or sympathise with any of the characters in this movie, coming closest to one of the cats, and that no doubt colours this review. However, I (and my wife) found that the script simply lacked humour, using contrivance to make any progress (the ice scene is pure klutz) while potential resolutions or critical events were chopped or ignored as if the audience were expected to have its collective brain in neutral. Of the main characters not even the mostly comatose Peter seemed plausible in his role. Even the ""other woman"" was eventually rendered silly and pointless by the scriptwriter despite a promising start and enthusiastic approach by Ally Walker.Perhaps Julia Roberts should have taken this role and brought her scriptwriter with her. Her lightest comedies such as Runaway Bride are still better than this. I would not see this movie again nor recommend it but then, it will probably do you no great harm to see it for yourself when at least you can make up your own mind. It had a chance to work and it is a pity the execution failed.', 'This was the picture which proved things could be all about Sandra Bullock. ""Speed"" - one year earlier - showed this. This picture proved it. A lot of people nowadays make fun of a typical Bullock picture and speak of her as negligible in this day and age. They probably forget or were never aware that she was hailed as America\'s new sweetheart back in \'95 and it was no idle chatter. There are very few actresses who can carry a picture on their own slight shoulders - I mean, really make it a success. Sure, Bill Pullman helped, but this really was Sandra all the way, in a sappy, soapy, cliché-ridden slight story of sudden romance usually very hard to buy into. But because Sandra is there on the screen throughout nearly every frame, it all works out, and you\'re rooting for her happiness in the final few minutes even knowing very well what is about to happen. It\'s like you\'ve seen it all before, but Sandra makes you want to see it again. We are all very fortunate, those of us who have seen this story, that it was Sandra in the central role and not someone like (shudder) Demi Moore. And if a guy is really fortunate, he may meet someone like Sandra in real life.', ""Warm and gentle comedy that shows Bullock to her best advantage, in her favorite role of shy closet beauty. Bullock obsesses about a man she sees briefly every day; when he is knocked unconscious she claims to be his fiancée. Then sparks begin to fly with the brother. Wonderful turns by Boyle and Warden as older family members. There's a great line by Boyle in this movie, something like you always imagine you'll have these long golden moments in life and then when you get there it lasts about a minute. I think Bullock was never better than in this movie, in later productions her shy modesty seems a little artificial. She and Pullman have just enough chemistry together to pull this through."", ""This is my absolute No.1 favourite feel good film of all time about a lonely girl who lives with her pretty little pet cat .

She has no family, and is usually stuck doing holiday shifts in the Chicago transit system (as a toll booth clerk on the elevated railway). She has noted one man who uses the station all the time (Peter Gallagher), and rescues him when he is thrown onto the train tracks just before a train comes into the station. Gallagher is in a coma and (due to a well-intentioned nurse) Bullock is introduced to the family of Gallagher as his fiancé. She tries to tell them the truth, but when she learns his grandmother (Glynis Johns) has a heart problem she hesitates. Soon she is treated as a member of this nice family as a member (well, she did save Gallagher, and she is thought to be his fiancé). Only his brother (Bill Pullman) has real doubts, and keeps mentioning them (and keeps apologizing for them. Bullock and Pullman find that they are also growing more attracted to each other. The film shows how these problems are resolved. And it is all done in a most charming manner.This is one of those films that would take only a few minutes to quickly resolve in the real world, where Bullock would have told the truth early on. But the audience is allowed to suspend it\'s disbelief because the characters are uniformly likable. Although Jack (Pullman) is constantly questioning Bullock\'s story, each time she gives a plausible explanation of what is going on, and Pullman likes her enough to accept these explanations. The only one who knows the truth is the family friend Sam (Jack Warden) and he too feels that the news has to be broken carefully (he loves the family and doesn\'t want them hurt). Oddly enough his one effort at meddling almost screws up the situation in the film for Bullock, Pullman, and Gallagher. Pullman also faces the truth and explains to his father (Peter Boyle) that he doesn\'t want to continue in the family business. Boyle\'s reaction becomes important too.The performances are flawless, and one finds oneself rooting for most of the cast (the sole exception is the actress playing ""Ashley"", Peter Galagher\'s actual girl friend). Her opposite number, ""Joe Jr."" is too comic a figure to dislike (in fact, at one point he thinks Pullman is annoying Bullock and offers to take care of him - not the act of a rat at all). For a sweet, lovable love tale WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING is hard to top. In the last decade only WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, WORKING GIRL, PRETTY WOMAN, NOTTING HILL, SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, and YOU\'VE GOT MAIL are on par with it, but the family becomes so important to Bullock in the plot this has a special warmth in it that is quite is different from most of the others.', 'WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING, in my opinion, is a sweet, charming, hilarious, and heartwarming romantic comedy. If you ask me, the way that Lucy (Sandra Bullock) and Peter (Peter Gallagher) met was very romantic. Also, in my opinion, Joey (Michael Rispoli) was a little crazy. This was because he just couldn\'t seem to leave Lucy alone. In addition, to me, Jack (Bill Pullman) was a really cute guy. Before I wrap this up, I\'d like to say, ""If you like romantic comedies or movies where people meet by chance, I highly recommend WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING!"" Now, in conclusion, when you see this sweet, charming, hilarious, and heartwarming romantic comedy, prepare to laugh and be touched.', 'This is a great movie to watch when you\'re feeling low.  It\'s fun to watch Lucy and Jack slowly fall for each other while trying to do the right thing by poor Peter, the comatose ""fiance.""  I\'ll just add that if you\'re looking for a movie to watch with your mom and dad, this is it!  No embarrassing sex scenes or unnecessary vulgar language, and it *still* manages to be a great time at the movies.  Now fancy that: a clean movie that entertains!  _While You Were Sleeping_ restores my faith in moviemakers.  :-)', ""Saw this film for the seventh or eighth or ninth time yesterday. Sigh, certainly one of the best films in the genre. Sandra Bullock looks the part and plays it with all her endearing charms. Possibly one of her better performances to date. Bill Pullman acted with all the appropriately confused gestures of a man in love but feels that he shouldn't be."", ""Next time you are depressed, this is the perfect pick me up.  If you like watching the same movies over and over, this is great for that also.  The chemistry between the two main characters is outstanding, much better than in this year's Two Weeks' Notice.  Laugh out loud and cry out loud."", ""A sweet and gentle, romantic film about how love sometimes slips in through the window rather than coming straight in through the front door, it's the one that put star Sandra Bullock into contention with Meg Ryan for the crown of America's Sweetheart.  And with good reason, because in `While You Were Sleeping,' directed by Jon Turteltaub, Bullock emerges as the epitome of the modern day `girl next door,' in the best and most sincere sense.  This is a film that explores one of the basic tenets of the human condition, the need to love and be loved, and makes no bones about what it's trying to accomplish along the way.  Clearly, the filmmakers want to make you feel good and entertain you at the same time.  And they succeed on both fronts.Lucy Moderatz (Bullock) lives alone in Chicago, where she has an apartment, a cat and a job with the CTA as a token taker for the train.  Her life is fairly uncomplicated and uneventful (read:  Dull), and the one thing she looks forward to in her daily grind is seeing a certain young gentleman who rides the train everyday and always passes through her toll booth.  She's doesn't even know his name, and they've never exchanged so much as a `Good morning,' but in her mind he's become the Prince Charming she's always dreamed about.Then on Christmas morning he passes through, but while waiting on the platform for the train he gets mugged and falls onto the tracks, unconscious.  And a train is coming.  Lucy runs to his aid and saves his life, but the severe head trauma he's sustained has put him in a coma.  At the hospital, they refuse to let her in to see him, as that is a privilege reserved for family members only; so in desperation she tells them that she is his fiancee, which does the trick.  But when his family-- his rather `large' family-- shows up, her ruse creates something of a sticky wicket. Everything is moving so fast and becoming so emotional that Lucy simply can't get in a word of explanation.  The next thing she knows, to the family she is their beloved Peter's (Peter Gallagher) intended (even though he's never said a word to them about her), and because the situation is so frantic and there's such concern about Peter, besides which it's Christmas, Lucy can't bring herself to tell them the truth.  So in an instant, her life is suddenly changed; she's surrounded by `family,' and she's `engaged' to her Prince Charming.  Even if he is, well...in a coma.Turteltaub has crafted and delivered a thoroughly engaging film in the tradition of Nora Ephron's `You've Got Mail' (the second best romantic comedy ever made) and `Sleepless In Seattle.'  He sets a perfect pace, and presents his endearingly eclectic assemblage of characters in the best possible way-- he makes you feel at home with them.  Most importantly, though, Turteltaub manages to make this a `sweet' film without being `saccharin' about it, which would have sunk it quicker than a deflated rubber raft in an undertow.  Instead, he pulls out all the right stops to make his film entirely Ephronesque and entertaining, and it works beautifully.  The humor is warm, and as the story moves along he builds upon that strong sense of `need' that is universal, then triumphs by satisfying that need in the end.Sandra Bullock has never been more winning or winsome than she is here; there's a special quality about her Lucy that makes you want to reach out to her.  She is, without question, the most vulnerable character Bullock has ever played.  There is very little of Annie (`Speed') or Gracie (`Miss Congeniality'), for example, about her; the closest to Lucy of any of her characters, in fact, would be Birdee in `Hope Floats.'  That is not to say there is anything `weak' about Lucy at all-- quite the contrary, in fact. There is a decided strength in the very benevolence of Lucy's nature, even in the way she wears her heart on her sleeve and especially inasmuch as she is not afraid to admit to herself what she really wants and needs.  This is an independent woman who accepts and meets any and all challenges of life, but keeps an open mind and, above all, an open heart.  And that is what makes Lucy so endearing; she's the one who brings a cake to the office to share with her co-workers for no other reason than the fact that it makes the world and everybody in it a little bit better.  That's what Bullock brings to her performance here, and it's what makes Lucy one of her most enduring and memorable characters.As for sliding in through the window rather than coming through the front door, that's exactly what Bill Pullman does with his portrayal of Peter's brother, Jack Callaghan.  He's the one who shows up after the fact, as it were, but very quickly makes a connection and ingratiates himself with the audience.  Initially, Jack seems to be playing the role of devil's advocate, his suspicions aroused by the fact that Peter has never mentioned Lucy to him; but that begins to change with some very subtle undertones that prove to be extremely effective.  And Pullman does a terrific job of developing his character in real time, which makes Jack convincing, and a piece of the puzzle that fits in perfectly.  A `character actor' type leading man, Pullman has a resume filled with varied and colorful characters, but Jack is his most engaging role ever, and he succeeds entirely with it.\nThe wonderful supporting cast includes Jack Warden (Saul), Peter Boyle (Ox), Micole Mercurio (Midge), Michael Rispoli (Joey) and the wonderful Glynis Johns, as beautiful and charming as ever as Elsie.  Warm and poignant, `While You Were Sleeping' is one to savor; this one's a keeper.  (BTW, the #1 romantic comedy?  Bonnie Hunt's `Return To Me').  10/10."", ""I adore this movie, it's easily one of my favourites. Another reviewer said that the best time to watch it is in the winter, and whilst I'm happy to watch it any time of the year, I would agree that it seems all the more magical when it's freezing cold outside, and you're snuggled under a blanket.I'm glad no other actors were given any of the roles in this film, it wouldn't have been the same. Sandra is adorable as Lucy. She has no sinister intent, she's just swept up in the commotion and in the end, falls in love with the whole family. Her speech toward the end chokes me up so much, it's completely heartfelt. Bill Pullman also shines, he falls for her gradually and their chemistry is so lovely to watch. If you want a gentle, unbelievably romantic film to watch on a cold evening, this is the one for you."", ""This was an extremely underrated movie. There were so many funny little segments and happenings in this movie. Like when the newspaper boy was delivering papers, and when they had the dinner conversation. If you just watch the movie for some good laughs and don't try to expect some big, deep storyline you will find that it is a VERY enjoyable movie. It had us all laughing till we......well you know what I mean. Sit back, get some popcorn and enjoy the show. There's nothing wrong with silly, senseless humor, is there? Even my husband enjoyed it. I've seen this movie more times than I probably should admit. But I laugh every time I see it. Another good choice...How to meet a guy in 10 days."", 'Was I shocked to read from the trvia section on this webpage that this movie was originally written for Demi Moore?  Of all the actresses in the world... Demi Moore???  She shed her innocence & sweetness when she made movies like ""One Night Stand"" (is it the correct title?) with Rob Lowe.  It\'s like seeing Rosanne Barr/Arnold as Lucy in this film.Great comical timing between Sandra & Bill.  The scene where they walk back to Lucy\'s apartment is especially brightens your day.  Of course, who can forget the whole Callaghan clan?  It\'s rare to see such a close-knitted family in US anymore.  It\'s heart-warming & touching & sweet & lovely & just terrific.This movie reminds me not to fall in love with a person just because of the looks.  Lucy was ready to marry Peter but didn\'t know that he was so self-obsessive (all HIS pictures in his wallet & home) and who would hurt squirrels & save them?  I\'m on Jack\'s side when I say ""ye-wo"".  Look at the soft spoken, sweet Jack who puts family first (remember his rocking chair?) & is more down-to-earth.Agreeing with the rest of the audience here who had posted their comments, this is THE movie to see when you\'re feeling a little blue, a little lonely, or just want to get out of reality for a few hours.Well, I\'ll be waiting for my Jack Callaghan now.  Wish you all enjoy the movie experience.', ""Almost all of my favorite comedies were made in the 1930s or 1940s, but I adore this one. Some of the striking things: how well the plot continues to work after Peter Gallagher's character goes through a change; the real chemistry between Bill Pullman and the delightful Sandra Bullock; the wonderful acting by Peter Gallagher as someone who comes to realize he's really NOT had a good character in his life so far (he's charming while also discovering this dismaying truth).Most of all it's the modesty and naturalness of Sandra Bullock - as a poor, lonely, still missing her late father, terribly sweet yet never coy, completely lovable, utterly sympathetic. We are WITH her in every frame. We want her to gain everything her heart desires - and we really LIKE Bill Pullman too.It seems to me that any romantic comedy rests largely on how likable the characters are - we must completely sympathize with them, feel with them - they can have difficulty deciding between love/career or love/location or between two people -- but we can't have difficulty deciding whether we yearn for them to be happy.In some respects, Sandra Bullock does seem a throwback - I could easily imagine this movie taking place during the Depression - though it would be a role reversal (in screwball comedies - which this really isn't - the woman are wealthy and the men are poor).There's an innate decency in the character played by Sandra Bullock - in that respect, it reminds me of the somewhat more genteel characters played by Irene Dunne in comedies like The Awful Truth or My Favorite Wife or Penny Serenade - you are watching a genuinely kind and thoughtful person when you see the characters - and it draws you in. (It's why I find it hard to imagine that Demi Moore was originally slotted to play this character - she has a toughness of heart that I cannot imagine for this character).This movie was written so well that I looked to see what else the screenwriters had done - nothing is listed! You can't go wrong with this movie - one of the top several movie comedies in the last half century."", 'This movie has it all -- Comedy, Romance, even a good touch of Drama. The characters are vibrantly real, the situations believable, and the plotline both humorous and plausible. Sandra Bullock is dynamite, and Bill Pullman is at his hottest. Mrrawr. I highly recommend this for any fan of romantic comedies, at any time of the year.~Thanks, TSFPWDE', ""After a lonely woman saves the life of a complete stranger, she's mistaken for his fiancé and slowly becomes integrated into his family, due to his coma. As her true identity couldn't be verified by anybody, everything seems to be well, until his brother shows up, whose character is about to play a very important role in the upcoming events.It's a lovely and romantic comedy, set in the heart of the winter holidays, which tells an improbable love story about two complete strangers who fall in love without their will and as much as they try to resist, as close they eventually become. It creates a warm and enjoyable atmosphere which lasts until the end. The actors play their roles very convincingly, making you care about their characters while keeping you eager to find out what will happen next and how it's going to end. Besides all of the above, it also manages to make you laugh from time to time, even out loud, just to spice things up a bit. It's a very good movie for everyone to enjoy, especially around the holidays, but not only.""]",18,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance']"

I was pleasantly surprised as Whipped is actually rather a good movie. I watched it with a group of friends and we laughed more than we had at many recent highly acclaimed Hollywood fluff comedies. This is an independent film and as such portrays its subject matter (sex and dating) without the usual Hollywood fakery. I distinctly suspect that people's opinion of this film will depend very much on their experience of life. If you've never dated or partied much you won't get this movie because you won't have met people like these characters.

No societal adjustment, expectations or learning to deal with these technologies has happened - they've just dropped out of the blue onto the characters, without any explanation or hint that they're widely used and accepted.This is a problem with much modern scifi - uncareful attention to details or backdrop. See instead Blade Runner's extremely careful writing and attention to this. Westworld built up the background of societal tolerance and interaction to the androids - where as Humans again just dropped us into this future with no warning (no one has dealt with attractive female bots living in family homes before? cmon.) Additionally, no discussion or hints to the societal attitudes towards the cookies/eggs. We can interrogate them but they're not exact copies to the point that extended decades of solitary confinement (which is illegal in all western nations even for multiple homicides) is OK? Even for a manslaughter self defence charge? Cmon.It was tweaked to lead the viewer into feeling the injustice of the main character's situation and then suddenly foisting surprise societal norms on the viewer. Poor writing.Very flashy technology ideas but anyone with any background in scifi reading will recognize these as being tried and true concepts developed from the 1920s through 60s. Blade Runner is the same - but the execution of the original and sequel was so environmentally accurate and self consistent, that is gives amazing life to these stock ideas -- but this episode was careless and gratuitous."", ""This episode like many other written by Mr. Brooker traffics in hoary old sc-fi cliches going back at least to Twilight Zone where they were far briefer, to the point & better written. Mr. Brooker has a one-note dystopian mind but it does not dig very deep. More interested in peoples' self-absorption with lifestyles & public opinions. Surprising - & sad/depressing - how popular this series is. Well, in a few years it will be buried in a quickly forgotten slag heap of quasi-techno dysopian memes. Good riddance.\nOn the plus side, John Hamm is a wonderful actor."", ""I do not watch black mirror, but as I saw that this episode is rated the best I tried.\nthe first half of the episode was great, good acting, interesting characters, and I really wanted to know what would happen next.\nBut second half turned into depressive boring story about people who can't solve problems in their social/family life regardless of the technology.\nThat is the reason I do not like whole black mirror - usually problems of main characters would not happen at all, or could be easily solved with some basic psychological knowledge or a help of a therapist.And the ending was absolutely terrible - illogical characters and conclusion whose only purpose was to be even more depressing."", 'After watching the First Season (3 episodes) of Black Mirror, I was intrigued enough to keep going (albeit not exactly sold on each hour).For the first three episodes of Season Two, I experienced much of the same. Some things I liked...somethings I did not. Again, as was a problem in S1, the show seemed to focus on the technology of each episode instead of developing the characters to their fullest.But then comes ""White Christmas"" (the finale of this season), and that episode changes everything. Starring Jon Hamm, this episode really showcases the type of storytelling that Black Mirror could (and should) be focusing on. This single episode is head-and-shoulders above everything that precedes it.So, on the whole, this is a 3.5 star season from me. However, the large caveat is that it looks like the show may have figured out the winning formula to maximize its potential. It will be very interesting to see if the momentum can be sustained into the third season.', ""Funny enough, at the end of the show the voice of the TV announcer advertised the next show: the conviction of a pedophile. It was completely unintentional and really ironic.John Hamm again perfectly plays the charismatic, but self serving ass. Him and another guy are isolated somewhere during Christmas so they begin telling their stories and how they arrived there. Slowly, but surely, the main thread of the Black Mirror show is revealed, showing us how technology can be misused by people who don't even comprehend the consequences. The finale is truly maddening, so to speak.I loved the first season of Black Mirror, but I was kind of disappointed with the second. This Christmas special is top notch and is certainly worth a watch. It was slightly too long and some of the hints were really obvious, as well as some issues being over dramatized to the loss of consistency. However it did reach its point rather well."", 'I enjoyed the first and third stories but the second story and the end were not enjoyable for me. I think this is the risk they took but creating three stories but I do praise the way that they linked the stories except the ending. I feel like the ending was just put in to have an additional link to an earlier story when it was not needed.', 'These episodes are about things that frighten us more than any threat physical or otherwise. The invite us into a world where we are alone and hopeless. We always think about eternity in some pit of hell, with devils and pitchforks. This is about the impossibility of redemption. There are forces at work that punish without mercy and leave people to face eternity alone. No human contact. No dignity. So what can they do. This one is about two men in an old house in the middle of nowhere, telling stories about why they have been imprisoned. These are horrible tales of murder and ugliness. One man is a master salesman who works the technology of the time to gain his prurient ends. The second a sad, unstable jerk who crosses his wife and is doomed to not see his child. No one really looks at her except we know that she faced some really sad times. These are powerful and almost sick.', 'After watching this, i am worry about new technology seriously than before', ""In this episode, there are quite a few story-lines but which all connect together at some point. It feels a little like Inception, with all the different levels of consciousness, and I like it! I love films/shows with a psychological emphasis that are somewhat heavy and dark to understand (though not too dark that it verges on horror). The story is well crafted and the different timelines are juxtaposed nicely so that everything comes together in the end. The acting is all great as well, with everyone doing their parts convincingly. The dialogue felt very natural and fluent which made the story really feel like a possible future. In addition, the visuals are on point and complements the show nicely. The effects- especially of the 'blocking' materializes the concept of the dark side of technology into something tangible and realizable.

Really the two men who were main characters are very good actors...', ""Very nice episode that's what exactly what I want to see."", 'A Dim View of Christmas\n After returning from a year and a half long service mission outside the country, my friends and family bombarded me with music, movies and television that I needed to catch up on. Something new to me was that Netflix was now producing its very own media. After avoiding it for months, I finally, reluctantly, succumbed to the raving reviews: Black Mirror was a must-see. \n The Christmas special and second season finale of creator Charlie Brooker\'s project, as always, is a chilling prediction of how humanities love of technology will one day lead us into the deepest depths of moral chaos. The apparent goal of the series is to portray the more sinister side of society\'s complete integration with computers, something most of us can imagine all too well. This particular episode takes a different approach to storytelling from the six proceeding it, and presents three different memories for the viewer, building the story and connecting dots as it goes on. What it leaves us with is a head full of thoughts, wondering who the real villain was, and how long do we have before social media takes us this far?\n We open with actors Jon Hamm as Matthew and Rafe Spall as Joe sharing their respective journeys that have lead them to where they\'re both at now: inside a snow-covered home, on Christmas Day, with some unspecified type of work to be done and no one else for company. The first two memories are of Matthew, who specialized in creating digital copies of his clients, called ""cookies"", and enslaving them to do the chores of their human counterparts. This is the most unbelievable and therefore flawed sequence of the episode. It fails to truly create a belief that such an invention could be used for such a task. But if this is it\'s only flaw, minor as it is, it is quite easy to overlook and indulge in the world being presented. The second memory is again from Matthew. In his spare time he helped guide his clients to find the women of their dreams, enabled by an eye implant that nearly everyone has installed. His life of bliss with his wife and child is shattered when the young client Matt coaches is killed by the women they attempt to seduce. The entire sequence is masterfully played out, and to the wary watcher, hints given in the forms of red lighting and angled camera shots predict the youth\'s doom. In one moment, Matthew is sharpening a knife inside the cabin while retelling his tale to Joe. As the scene cuts back to the image of the young client talking with the woman, the sound of the ringing knife can be heard for a moment longer. Yet, by the end of Matthew\'s recollection, we are still unsure how he got to be inside the snow-covered cottage. Joe\'s reaction is one of horror to Matthews stories, and Matthew comments that from what he can see, Joe is a good man. Sinister tones creep to life as Joe quietly shakes his head and says, ""I am not a good man."" and so begins the final sequence of the episode. \n We are told the life of Joe, who lived simply and somewhat happily with his girlfriend Beth. He is quickly driven to a life of lonely obsession when Beth becomes pregnant, but has already made up her mind to abort the baby. Joe becomes violent at the thought of giving up his child, and Beth, frightened by his reaction, ""blocks"" him permanently. But blocking in this dystopia is much more than what we know now. The same eye implants used by Matt to link with Harry in the first memory are brought back, and the block reduces Beth and all images of her to indistinct grey blobs incapable of communication. Joe begins to obsess over Beth and his child, and eventually discovers that she kept it. Several years pass, and upon seeing Beth in the news, a casualty in a train wreck, he begins to do all he can to see his child. Red light once again foretells tragedy, emphasis through camera shots on objects give them a sense of weight and meaning, and the director succeeds beautifully in tying the loose ends of each story together into one.\n The ending is both sickening and saddening, with a dash of dark humor to finish it off. Never have we ever felt so much sympathy for a blinking light. We are left to wonder how any society could be so cruel, but then to take a step back and wonder if we are not, in some small way, already mirroring the same problems. Superb acting and special effects combine to make this the best episode to date. Just as shakespeare presents a timeless caricature of human nature, Black Mirror presents a terrifyingly believable future that is perhaps already here.', ""This was amazing !! watching this episode makes me wonder how did they make that they can't be humans . black mirror became not only a series you watch but an idea stuck in your mind for the next 2 or 3 days after you watch an episode .\nand this one was the best it was full of any thing you would like to see in a show\nperfect acting , getting emotional for the characters , plot twists , showing many different ideas and mixing them up amazingly in one hour show\nthank you black mirror.""]",14,"['Comedy', 'Music', 'Romance']"

His performance is a mixture of fierce, subtle rage and over the top antics, the same mix that helped Al Pacino become so popular.  And like Pacino, Cagney's over acting is not a blemish to the film.  It's used to make a character larger than life, and Cody Jarrett is most certainly that.  The supporting cast doesn't stick out, even though there are some good performances.  Cagney overshadows them all, which is both a good and bad thing, because it leaves the film without strong supporting characters.  Walsh's favors wide shots, and him and cinematographer Sidney Hickox set up some great looking shots.  It was the first gangster film to really have that epic scope along the lines of `The Godfather'. Overall though, it feels as if Walsh was afraid to stretch the noir boundaries too much, and there a few scenes that suffer for it. \nBesides a classic Cagney performance and good directing, the movie isn't much else.  The story is pretty much a by the books noir film, which had reached it's peak by the end of the 40's.  They only real atypical element of the film was Jarrett, who is written to be basically a stone cold nutzo without the palest hint of what motivates him, a new idea that I think didn't work to the best of it's potential.  I never really hated Cody Jarrett, and the screenplay doesn't given anything else besides that option. It has some snappy dialogue here and there, but for the most part it's rather bland noirish stuff.   Cagney's great, sure, but it is a performance that walks a thin into being too overblown, which thankfully Cagney never does.  Walsh's is a great director who wasn't valiant to bring this to the level of rawness it could've been (the element is present, no doubt, but it feels too restrained).   Everything else is rather average old Hollywood noir stuff, neither great nor terrible.    See it for Cagney, but don't expect the revolution some think this movie is.7/10* * * / * * * *"", ""If anything, `White Heat' is a one-man show, and I'm not saying that because that's how it's written or even made, but because James Cagney reaps attention whenever he's on screen.   His performance is a mixture of fierce, subtle rage and over the top antics, the same mix that helped Al Pacino become so popular.  And like Pacino, Cagney's over acting is not a blemish to the film.  It's used to make a character larger than life, and Cody Jarrett is most certainly that.  The supporting cast doesn't stick out, even though there are some good performances.  Cagney overshadows them all, which is both a good and bad thing, because it leaves the film without strong supporting characters.  Walsh's favors wide shots, and him and cinematographer Sidney Hickox set up some great looking shots.  It was the first gangster film to really have that epic scope along the lines of `The Godfather'. Overall though, it feels as if Walsh was afraid to stretch the noir boundaries too much, and there a few scenes that suffer for it. \nBesides a classic Cagney performance and good directing, the movie isn't much else.  The story is pretty much a by the books noir film, which had reached it's peak by the end of the 40's.  They only real atypical element of the film was Jarrett, who is written to be basically a stone cold nutzo without the palest hint of what motivates him, a new idea that I think didn't work to the best of it's potential.

She does indeed go far out on the proverbial limb here playing a beyond-vivacious parolee attempting to prove she was framed for murder (a body was found in the trunk of her car after she ran a red light...big laughs). After an energetic animated credits sequence--which is much more fun than the rest of the picture--we have nothing to look at but Madonna\'s black mascara and red lips set off by her platinum hair and pale complexion. What else is there? Griffin Dunne seems defeated playing Maddy\'s keeper, while the poor-choice supporting cast struggles to get laughs with lousy dialogue. It\'s an unfortunate set-back to the talents of director James Foley, who unwisely allows his star to run rampant in the spirit of the nutty slapstick films from the 1930s (but even Katharine Hepburn in ""Bringing Up Baby"" had a human side). Wretched. * from ****', 'I was actually planning to see this movie when I noticed it in my TV guide but after about 5 minutes decided time is definitely more precious than ""Who\'s That Girl"" could ever be worth. Describing how bad Madonna\'s acting looks like is impossible and the end result is one of the most annoying characters ever captured on film. This crap is an insult to movies and intellect. I almost never! rate a movie I don\'t see from start to finish, but in this case the former is impossible. 2/10', ""As most positive reviews have already stated \x96 If your not a Madonna fan, you probably won't like this movie. However, as a Madonna fan, I saw this movie when it played on cable the first time, around 1988, I enjoyed this movie then and I still enjoy it now. It's not deep or even based in reality but it is just very fun to watch. Madonna gives a great performance as Nikki Finn; she's funny, sexy and assertive. It's clear she carries the film; I've read other user's comparisons to Judy Holiday and Marilyn Monroe, and to me, that's not bad company to be associated with. Her character is simply mesmerizing on screen, in late 80's fashion of course...I don't know about the rest of you, but I just enjoy seeing the Madonna we grew to love, before her exploitive stage, before she 'gave the farm away' so to speak, she was sexier then.How about the soundtrack? Great especially the theme song\x85 And Griffin Dunne is hilarious by the way. B+"", ""The singer / icon known as Madonna in the 1980's was Nikki Finn. The outrageous and very funny little girl with a sketchy past could only be played Madonna. Who's that Girl is a romantic comedy about two completely different who end up falling in love under the most unusual circumstances. Although its not a great comedy, the story is genuine and the acting holds up. Surprisingly, Madonna does not use her sexuality as much as she has in the past and in future films. Her funniness and charm wins over the audience. Although she is very sexy, she does not use her eye candy to draw the audience. A coming of age drama in the sense that Madonna is growing up and trying to break away from her past. In the end, the movie showcases Madonna as an actress and not the singer. Not since Desperately Seeking Susan two years before, that a film took a chance to promote Madonna off the stage (music) and onto the big screen as a comedic actress."", 'I saw this movie the day it opened in NYC, at the Ziegfield.  At the time Madonna was not quite the cultural icon she is now.  She had a couple of hits, was very good in ""Desparately Seeking Susan"" and I had tickets to see her in concert at Giants Stadium. ""Who\'s That Girl?"" gives Madonna an actual role to play, which is not just a variation of her own personality.  She does the madcap/heroine routine better than you might think.  Griffin Dunne is very well cast as the man around to witness all the shenanigans.The story involves a huge cat named Murray, a bride-to-be who has slept with every cabbie in NYC, a mean father-in-law, and a key.  There are a lot of car chases and cops trailing their path. All the elements of a screwball comedy intact.  Sir John Mills is seen briefly.  He shares a glass of champagne with the leads and has the greatest apartment on the Upper West Side, complete with a rain forest and everything. Compared to most Madonna movies (the ones I\'ve been able to tolerate anyway), this is fantastic.  On its own, its not that bad.  6/10.\nPS The concert was lousy.', 'I kid you not. Yes, ""Who\'s That Girl"" has the distinction for being one in a string of Madonna\'s films that bombed, but I actually liked this movie more than ""Desperately Seeking Susan"". In ""Susan"", Madonna\'s character is relegated to being second-fiddle to Rosanna Arquette and is not given much to work with. No disrespect to Rosanna, but in WTG Madonna plays this zany, outrageous character, only done in an 80s style. While it may seem ""cheesy"" today, this is actually one of Madonna\'s best and one of her most underrated films.Madonna plays Nikki Finn, an ex-con who is sent to the slammer for a crime she didn\'t commit. She\'s being released from jail after four years of good behavior. Griffin Dunne, who is also a very underrated actor, plays Louden Trott, a lawyer who has the unpleasant task of picking her up from jail to take her to the bus station. Of course, when these two get together, that\'s when the madness happens. Sir John Mills has a small role as the rich businessman who has a huge mansion in the middle of Manhattan with a rainforest(???) on his roof. This movie parodies everything. Rich people, the sleazy characters who live in Harlem and totally destroy Louden\'s Rolls-Royce, the gay cops who follow Madonna and Dunne around town, and Dunne\'s stuck-up fiance Wendy Worthington who has purportedly slept with every cab driver in New York City (played by Haviland Morris, who was Jake\'s girlfriend Caroline in Sixteen Candles). Hilarious! Plus, Dunne is also in charge of a rare breed of leopard reminiscent of ""Bringing Up Baby"". Plus, Madonna had a great platinum blonde 80s look back in those days and the movie has a great soundtrack. Throw this all into the mix and you have the zaniness of WTG.Madonna is the queen of deadpan acting. There are times in the movie where she says a line totally straight and surprisingly, it turns out to be funny! That\'s how some of the best comedy should be played - straight. Madonna should have done more comedy and it was a shame that she did not choose to do so. Later on she became much more controversial and got into more of the dark, sexually-charged roles in the notorious movies ""Body of Evidence"" and ""Dangerous Game"". Some people say Madonna cannot act, and that is fine, people are entitled to their opinion, but I believe the real problem is that people cannot see the difference between Madonna playing a character on film, instead they still see only Madonna and that is main reason why she is given more respect for her music than for her movies. It\'s still a fun, screwball comedy of the 80s. Not for everyone, I\'m sure some of you will dislike it, so I would recommend it mainly for Madonna fans, but you never know, you might be surprised and like it! Interesting note: One of Madonna\'s friends from her early-80s New York club days, Coati Mundi, who plays Raoul, was a member in the bands Kid Creole and The Coconuts and Savannah Band.', ""This movie is a good bit of fun, better than the critics and the IMDb rating would lead you to believe. To be fair, I should note that I am a huge fan of Madonna (as most fans of this movie tend to be), so that may very well be a factor in your enjoyment of the movie.Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a squeaky-voiced girl with hair like Jean Harlow and lips as red as a fire truck. Having been framed for the murder of her boyfriend and after spending four years in the slammer, she's determined to prove her innocence upon her release from prison, and enlists the help of Loudon Trott, a lawyer who was merely supposed to drive her to the bus station, but ends up getting caught in Nikki's tornado of trouble.Madonna's performance is mostly enjoyable in this film, even if their are some noticeable cracks in her metaphorical armor of acting. Griffin Dunne does a great job playing the straight man, saying many funny and quotable things when being driven to the brink of madness by Nikki's actions. There are a few lines and over the top jokes I can't help but roll my eyes at, and the film never bothers to pay off a certain joke that is set up on three occasions.My theory is that most people just went into this film with a bad attitude, already convinced it would be terrible because of Madonna's previous film, Shanghai Surprise (which is a completely abysmal movie in every way). So if you go into this film with an open mind and no more expectations than a good time, you may very well enjoy it."", 'If you like Madonna or not, this movie is hilarious!! I am a Madonna fan and did see this in the theater at the time of its release. However, over time it has not lost its silliness and pure fun. Sure there are some bad lines & cheesy acting but the whole film is just a screwball comedy with Madonna actually carrying the whole film with great bombast. She is cute,funny, and is the only comedic role of her movie career. Madonna usually just plays \'herself\' in roles but watching her as Nikki Finn in this film, she really seems like somebody else for once. Of course the film is directed by James Foley (who filmed the dramatic and haunting \'At Close Range\' with Sean Penn & Christopher Walken) and co-stars Griffin dunn (\'After Hours\') who is also brilliantly cast and has fun with the material. The story is nothing genius and don\'t expect some climatic ending but if you are ever in the mood to watch a fun, clean, 80\'s romp or if you are a Madonna fan than this is a MUST SEE. The Soundtrack is also very notable and contains 4 Madonna songs: the #1 hit ""Who\'s That Girl"", the #2 hit ""Causing A Commotion"" and the beautiful and one of her best ever ballads ""The Look of Love\'\'(Top 10 Hit in the UK) and ""Can\'t Stop"" a left over pop ditty from the \'True BLue\' sessions the year before. It is only on VHS but will soon be available on DVD.', 'I love this movie!!  Sure I love it because of Madonna but who cares - it\'s damn funny!!! *ALANiS Rocks*.  When I first saw this film in the theatres back in 1987, I thought it was all out hilarious!  Madonna is so funny and I love her dubbed accent and wacky/funky look.  The all-time funniest part is when Madonna(Nikki) screams at a man who is about to get into a taxi.  And also when Griffin Dunne(Louden)trips and falls at the apartment interview scene.  **ALANiS Rocks**.  Madonna\'s character Nikki steals/shop lifts and fools people throughout the whole movie - her hilarious antics are enough to keep you on the floor the whole time.  ""Didn\'t rob nothin\', when you rob a store you stick up the cashier.  We busted a few tapes, there\'s a bit of a difference""  I love that!!! It\'s classic. ***ALANiS Rocks***.  I don\'t know why this movie got slammed the way it did. I see nothing wrong with it - course maybe if you\'re a huge Madonna fan then whatever she does is just awesome.  Anyone out there who wants to see some funny, classic entertainment then watch ""Who\'s That Girl?""  And another very important fact that of which should be known to all man kind or at least to all that exist, ALANiS will always ""rock ya"" completely to the end! So does Madonna in this film, and just entirely! Her acting is superb!', 'One of the funniest, most romantic, and most musical movies ever; definitely worth renting/buying especially if you have a taste for older style of cinematography. The animals and the songs alone will make you smile while watching the movie.  A definite must for Madonna fans.  :o)', ""Fantastic, Madonna at her finest, the film is funny and her acting is brilliant. It may have been made in the 80's but it has all the qualities of a modern Hollywood Block-buster. I love this film and i think its totally unique and will cheer up any droopy person within a matter of minutes. Fantastic."", 'i have to rate this movie at a 10. i\'m sorry but i think it\'s classic comedy. then, if you\'re rating it to other Madonna movies...well, what? you wanna tell me it wasn\'t her best movie ever? didn\'t Mira Sorvino win an Oscar for almost the same performance not ten years later? please, this movie deserves much more credit than it gets. plus, i like to think of it as an A+ sociological study into the lifestyles of the 80\'s. remember when you could shoplift from Sam Goody and Cartier in the same day? remember when women wore bushy eyebrows proudly? so it was no ""Last Emperor"", it was still good. there are certain movies i\'d be willing to watch everyday. three, actually, that pep up my day and make me smile. if you like ""Who\'s That Girl?"" then i\'d also recommend ""Party Girl"" and ""Romy and Michelle\'s High School Reunion"".', 'For late-80s cheese, this really isn\'t so bad.  There are a lot of pretty funny throwaway one-liners (""That was grand theft!"" - ""Thanks!"") and Madonna gives a fine performance; nothing award-worthy here, but that goes for Razzies as well as Oscars. I\'m curious to know if the movie would have been better received if she had used her regular (pre-British influenced) speaking voice rather than the hyper-Bronxy accent used instead. Oh well. As a side note, I got to meet one of the actors who played one of the motorcycle cops through my work; he said that it was a fun film to work on but gave me the sad news that the actor who played Buck the UPS delivery guy died about a year after Who\'s That Girl']",13,['Comedy']
Why Did I Get Married Too?,3.2,3.35,"['Comedy', 'Romance']","Four couples struggle to save their marriages once again on their annual marriage retreat, while each of them battle through financial, physical, mental, and emotional issues.",sadness,"[""The first installment in this series was decent enough to spark my interest in checking out the sequel. Unfortunately, Why Did I Get Married Too was a sub-par attempt to reprise Perry's previous venture in couples therapy. There were a few redeemable aspects of the movie, namely, some of the characters have been further developed. The new aspects of their relationship dynamics made it interesting to see how their lives have changed. Also appreciated are the moments of bare sincerity in the dialogue. There are a few scenes where a husband and wife could be seen having a believable, vulnerable discussion about the impact of individual choices on their relationship without the bravado of over-the-top displays.Sadly, any redeemable parts of this film were heavily flanked in overwrought dramatic scenes in an effort to create meaningful turning points, and mostly uncomfortable attempts at humor. It's as if Perry thought that hearty laughter from the characters in the more comedic scenes would somehow make the scene funnier; the mission was not accomplished. Also, Perry decided to have the movie be more dependent on Janet Jackson's character as the center pin of the plot, which is an unfortunate shift because she simply doesn't have the skills to deliver. While she is more highly emotive throughout this film, she isn't believable. It just left you feeling uncomfortable watching it happen. To make matters worst, the scene transitions felt abrupt, like you were being yanked by the collar from one end of a room to another.On a more pitiful note, there were several lines and scenes that were way too close to those from the movies Boomerang, Soul Food, and Unfaithful. It's one thing to have a trite storyline; it's a whole other issue when scenes are taken from other movies and executed so similarly to the original that the forerunner immediately comes to the viewer's mind. This kind of poorly-done mimicry leaves you feeling duped by and embarrassed for the person attempting it. The worst part was the ending, which felt rushed and forced. Perry is certainly invested in happy endings, but this was insulting to the characters and the viewers.Overall, the only reason I continued to watch the movie was not because it was in any way worth it, but because I have a sometimes silly desire to finish what I've started. I hope that Perry soon decides to employ screenwriters to broaden the scope of what seems to be a one-man show and production because movie scriptwriting requires a level of skill that he has not yet polished."", 'The original ""Married"" was not Oscar material, but it was at least a solid 5 or 6 on a 10-point scale. It had some freshness and some unpredictability to it that at least made for some fun entertainment.The sequel is none of these things.Quite possibly one of the worst movies I\'ve ever seen. Clichéd to the hilt. Weak, repetitive, IQ-lowering humor bordering on sloppy slapstick. From the slow beginning to the disappointing end, this movie is starved. The plot is begging for more development, the actors are aching for better utilization of their characters, and the script is pleading to be burnt to ashes.Like Perry\'s ""I Can Do Bad,"" this movie seems rushed as if very little thought was put into making it. I have no idea how the mess I saw on that screen made it pass the editing booth. There\'s just no way...unless someone was trying to beat some kind of deadline and concluded that since this movie is guaranteed to win the box office, ""who cares about quality? We make it and \'they\' will come. Release it."" And release this stink bomb of a film they did. What a waste.I hate to be all negative, so I will try to offer one positive. Like in the first movie, Janet stretches her acting and almost comes off as a decent actor. Kudos to Perry for helping get that out of her I guess.And with that, I\'ll turn in as I\'m sleepy after watching that sleep-inducing tripe of a film. Maybe in the morning I\'ll feel less angry about giving away two hours of my time that I will never get back. And don\'t say you weren\'t warned...even if you\'re a Tyler Perry fan, you will find my critique to be true.Toodles', 'I had doubts about watching the prequel to this movie to begin with (""Why Did I Get Married?""). It\'s rating upon this site is quite low, and the opinions of my peers were not very positive either. However, after viewing and being very moved by Perry\'s ""For Colored Girls"", I wanted to sample more of his artistry anyhow. Though I was apprehensive of the first movie, I did not find it to be so terrible after I saw it.The characters introduced can sometimes come off as overly abrasive, loud, and at other times, so meager, and pitiful, that sympathy is difficult to conjure for them. Upon watching their stories further, and seeing the plights of the individuals and their relationships, the drama and madness behind all their actions become understood and somewhat justifiable, although they can at times be outlandish. As such, I chose to view their plots an exaggerated portrayal of the adversities within a marriage, rather than an exact one.I was curious to see how the characters\' lives continued after that terrible vacation in Colorado. Sadly, I killed the entire ""Why did I Get Married?"" enterprise for myself. In my opinion, the sequel ""Why Did I Get Married Too?"" very much trivialized it\'s predecessor. When at one point I thought that the scripts were very much related to love, loss, and moving forward, this movie has conveyed nothing to it\'s viewers either than; If you have low self esteem or a husband who drowns his pain and neglect with alcohol, a new man is all you need make it all better. This theme was very romantic and well deserved in the first instalment, but pressed a very negative button for me in this one, as it was both unromantic and, in my opinion, undeserving. Plus, I can\'t take Dwayne Johnson\'s face seriously. Maybe that\'s what ruined everything. When I see him I just think bad movies and even worse wrestling. Not to mention, he didn\'t really ""fit"" the scene. He looked awkward. I don\'t know how else to put it, folks. Just awkward. At any other point, I would suggest viewing it for oneself, but I\'m trying to help you, so I won\'t.Initially, this movie left me looking at the screen with a quizzical expression, wondering if any of these characters had learnt ANYTHING at all from the psychological studies, exercises, and scream-match trips they take annually. Upon realizing the answer was ""no"", I then began to feel like I, in turn, wasted my own time, having watched movies in the hopes that they would. Of course, utter peace and harmony does not a good movie make, but the extent of their drama and angst says that a lesson ought to be learnt by at least one of them BEFORE the end of the movie. Oddly enough, the only one who I thought really did so, was the only character that was single throughout the whole movie! Maybe there\'s a point to be made with that... But still, there was no satisfactory ending to this. However, that is by no means a reason to continue this story any further. I knew I should have stopped when I saw Angela\'s pink flask.', ""This film is one of the worst I've seen. The four female characters are hideous - spoiled, whining, loud mouthed, overbearing, jealous, precious. In real life I can't imagine people like these four being tolerated.The plot is poor, the execution slow and tortured. It takes an age for the movie to gain any impetus. The point of the film, I imagine, is to examine the lives of couples who are married. It would certainly put off anybody contemplating union.The male characters act like puppets, afraid to hurt the feelings of their counterparts. They appear to be unable to exert their own will.Avoid the film if you come across it. A waste of nearly two hours with an ending which is totally incredible."", ""Why Did I Get Married Too?The motivation for men getting married is so that when they hit-on other women, they'll see his ring and know that he is capable of commitment.And while the impetuses behind the marriages in this drama are varied, the participants are having trouble remembering theirs.When four married couples – Patricia (Janet Jackson) and Gavin (Malik Yoba), Sheila (Jill Scott) and Troy (Lamman Rucker), Angela (Tasha Smith) and Marcus (Michael Jai White) and Terry (Tyler Perry) and Diane (Sharon Leal) – reunite for their annual vacation, they spend the bulk of their time scrutinizing their problematic relationships. Things go awry, however, when Sheila's ex-husband shows up looking to make amends.The sequel to Why Did I Get Married, this conjugal continuation plods its way through its predecessor's maudlin footsteps, dispensing off-kilter advice disguised as connubial sagacity.Besides, if men were designed to be faithful, directly after getting married, their penis would retract. (Red Light)"", ""To appreciate why my review is below average you will need to see 'Why did I get married' Basically you have four couples in the original and each have their issues and by the end each issue is resolved one way or the other. So the problem for the sequel is how do you follow up on issues that have already been resolved. The answer is to create new issues or rehash old ones. This is how the sequel goes. So we have four couples each dealing with issues again. Now there's nothing wrong with that if the issues are plausible and played out properly and have credible endings. This is where 'Why did I get married too' goes sadly wrong. Some issues were credible but the endings were not or were not given an ending whilst the most prominent issue, well I'm struggling to understand what it actually was. I had no empathy with the female lead and felt that she should have been charged with crime and I think in real life most of those characters would have nothing to do with her after what she directly caused. Sadly this is a sequel that should never have been and I can only speculate that it failed because a certain actress only signed up for the sequel so she could have the most prominent role and in so giving it to her the movie failed. You will know to whom I refer when you watch this movie. So watch this movie if only to understand why a lot of sequels fail miserably as this one did!"", 'Why Did I Get Married Too (2010)I didn\'t see the first one, so can only approach this for what it was--an ensemble film that works with the problems of contemporary marriage. Yes, in particular this focuses on black America, but Perry seems to pull out the ways this part of the culture resembles American culture at large. And so there lies the flaw, in a way, of making much of this movie: it inevitably revisits familiar material. Does it do it well, or with freshness, or any edge of originality? Maybe only in the sense that it represents very very well to do African Americans, a segment not typical Hollywood fodder.This isn\'t a rotten film, as some viewers like to say, but it isn\'t as well acted, sharply written, exquisitely filmed, or narratively interesting as it could have been by far. And it compares badly with Perry\'s wonderful ""For Colored Girls."" You might say this is ambitious--there are nine full blown main characters, each more or less equally dealing with their spouses--but in a way it is overwhelming, and for me at least I had trouble keeping all the story lines straight at first. But these narratives don\'t ever quite get fleshed out as fully as they need to be, both for their own sake, as small stories, but for the movie as a whole, since none of the content really goes deep. I don\'t mean it isn\'t emotional, but it\'s moving in a surface way.If you do give this a shot, be aware that the second half of the movie is much better. It\'s less chitchatty, more serious, has better acting (including some really moving, intense stuff) and has the various plots intertwine and get a little edgy. But also be aware that none of this is especially well done. It rides in a style that might really be called prime time television, interesting but not amazing or transforming.', 'I was a bit too young to remember the last Tyler Perry movie I saw, and was never exposed to any of his actual plays. Thus, I held neutral expectations for ""Why Did I Get Married Too,"" though I heard that its predecessor was quite good. I ALMOST left the theater taken aback at Perry\'s exceptional directing and understanding of human emotions. Unfortunately, that was all but squashed by one of the worst endings I\'ve seen in a long time.The plot is quite straightforward. Terry (Tyler Perry) and Diane (Sharon Leal) embark on their yearly couples retreat (sounds familiar?) with their friends, all of whom are also married. Marcus (Michael Jai White) and Angela (Tasha Smith) are constantly at odds with each other for any reason they (as in mostly Angela) can fathom, Troy (Lamman Rucker) and Sheila (Jill Scott) are battling the all-too-real consequences of unemployment, while Patricia (Janet Jackson) and Gavin (Mailk Yoba) serve as the model relationship for the group. The retreat is brought back to a harsh reality when Sheila\'s former husband, Mike (Richard Jones), unknowingly books time with the group\'s beach house for the weekend. His interruption, unbeknownst to the couples, tests their relationships as their own flaws slowly unravel and manifest themselves.Perry\'s playwriting influences are made apparent right from the beginning, as each character behaves and builds in a play-like manner. This works strongly in his favor, as each character is developed well enough to bring significant amounts of powerful tension and drama later into the film. Perry also fiddles with the emotions of his audience like a puppet master, tossing them from angst to anger to happiness with incredible ease and lightning-fast timing. Every actor was stretched to their emotional limits in this film; I found Jackson\'s performance shockingly spectacular here and her conflict with Yoba to be one of the most intense partnerships I\'ve seen in a while. In short, I felt like I was yanked from my seat and strapped onto the front of an emotional roller-coaster right from the beginning. Unfortunately, that trains flew off the tracks into a horrible crash landing in the film\'s final ten minutes. While the ending was somewhat unexpected, it was certainly not the ending I *wanted* to expect. It was as if Perry waited an hour and 50 minutes to cram all of the clichéd, fantasy, happy-ending-feel-goodness Hollywood delivers in spades. The last two minutes were especially insulting. It was so appalling for me, in fact, that it made me spend the two hour train ride home realizing many of the other plot holes and unanswered questions Perry made irrelevant for me beforehand. I\'m just going to assume that Perry didn\'t write the ending; it makes more sense.All in all, the film is exceptionally well-made, incredibly moving and does not rely on its previous installment for the audience to wholly appreciate. Even despite its questionably poor ending, I highly recommend it.', 'OK, so anyone expecting to go to a movie and see a relatively light hearted ""Madea"" style movie will be a bit surprised. This movie had its funny parts, as the couples continued their spats from the previous movie, but it seems that Mr Perry wanted to go a different route with his ending, and though I will not let on what happened, suffice to say, it was somewhat unexpected. Also, some plot points could have been explained better, as their seemed to be conflict after conflict thrown in just to make sure everyone had something nefarious going on. All in all, not a bad movie, but different. Don\'t expect to go away uplifted after seeing this movie.', 'I don\'t think I have ever laughed harder at a movie I watched out of boredom. I found this gem as I was perusing Netflix instant-watch, and I\'m glad I decided to watch it.Comedy is prevalent within the first couple scenes. Unlike many of the films made today, it was refreshing to watch a movie that could make me laugh while exploring serious subject matter. The film covers all realms of marriage difficulties, many of which are real problems facing today\'s couples.As I was new to Perry\'s films, I looked up some of his other movies on IMDb. To my disdain, almost all of his films received bad reviews. Why? Perry took the ""black stereotype"" and made a farce out of it. The movie is completely satirical, and should be perceived as such. Also - Tasha Smith made me laugh the entire movie.', 'I am usually not a fan of Tyler Perry. For one thing, if you\'ve seen one of his movies, you\'ve pretty much seen them all. They often revolve around an aging plot of over the top dysfunctional relationships that somehow work themselves out by the end of the movie. Most of his movies also includes the Madea subplot, which usually is out of synchronization with the rest of the movie.Why Did I Get Married Too shows Perry\'s potential as a legitimate screenplay writer when he let\'s go of his overrated Madea act. Married Too feels like it belongs on the big screen, whereas other films produced and directed by Perry feel like plays adapted for the movies. It could be that the whole Madea act, while I must admit is often very funny, is just too over the top and unbelievable for some of the serious material he tries to mix it with. Stevie Wonder could see Madea is just a man in a fat suit! It could also be the more colorful beach scenes that add flavor to this film, whereas most of his other films are set mostly in Atlanta or some other urban area. With those films, you only get mediocre set pieces with generic pictures of the city backdrop thrown in just to let you know where the story takes place. It\'s rather boring, and the whole thing with Atlanta as the main setting for his films is getting rather old. Just like M. Night Shyamalan and his affinity to write his story lines in and around Philadelphia, it shows a laziness to screenplay writing and providing the viewer with a different experience. We know that you lived in Atlanta at the time of your big break, Tyler. And trust me, I understand if you don\'t know one thing about other urban areas. However, let me point out that the great screenplay writers go out and do their research on other locations and other details of a storyline in order to be more diverse in what they offer the viewer. Perry will never get past the black community as his base viewership or his core fans if he doesn\'t change things up. John Singleton, F. Gary Gary and even Spike Lee understand this.Anyway, once again, Perry relies on star power to camouflage his lack of depth as a screenplay writer and director. Married Too has a nice cast that includes Janet Jackson, Jill Scott, Malik Yoba, Tasha Smith, Michael Jai White, Cicely Tyson, Lou Gossette Jr., Dwayne Johnson and Tyler Perry minus Madea.The reason I give it such a high rating is because unlike most of Perry\'s films most of the performances and scenarios weren\'t over the top and the problems the couples faced here seem reasonable. It\'s hard to mix comedy and drama in the same film. Perry has tried it in the past, but he\'s not at all good at it. However, he does a good job in this film. Comedy is kept in check here, while drama takes the front seat. With his other films, the drama elements are often overshadowed by the Madea routine and her shenanigans.This film also stood out because unlike most movies, it doesn\'t have a sappy, ""all bad things turn out good"" ending. I love the two main plot twists in the movie. They were totally unexpected.Could this movie have been better? Yes. Do I still recommend it? Yes. Now, if we will get more effort out of Perry in his future movies remains to be seen. Let\'s hope so. Tyler Perry has an excellent opportunity that other people of color in the film industry don\'t. Please be more responsible and creative with this opportunity.', ""I see a lot of negative reviews for this movie. Let it be known that most of Tyler Perry's movies are in fact repetitive. However, the movie isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Like every movie, it has its flaws and good points. Instead of pointing pointing out its flaws that everyone seems to bash on so much. Imma do the thing that no other idiot-critic bothered to do. Lets just point out the good points. 1. I think it was a well-planned sequel. It highlights key references from the first one and at least the characters never changed besides Mike. They still have the same characteristics and good points that made them funny in the first movie. 2. Yes, I admit, it was dramatic, but think about this for a second. A relationship isn't meant to be perfect. And Tyler Perry DEFINITELY says that. The reason everything is better at the end when they kiss is because they don't want to end up like Pat. Pat is their template for a relationship. 3. The message. Life can take a drastic turn so don't live it being angry at your spouse for stupid reasons and selfish ones at that. Relationships can go down hill because of money. This movie only proves what money and greed can do to people. 4.Making up for flaws. No relationship is perfect. It shows how people can change and how you can turn it around for the better. 5. The movie is more about how the actors go about their characters. So whether it was dramatic or not, these were some really good actors and the way they played off their scripts were exactly how anyone else would talk.My last complain about you critics who stomp this movie in the dirt is... HOW ON EARTH CAN YOU GIVE THIS MOVIE A LOWER RATING THAN DRAGON BALL EVOLUTION!!!!???? Geez -__-"", '""Why Did I Get Married Too?"" is a good movie. I think it plays pretty well, and the situations are really good. One of the things that makes this movie good is that it\'s not a copy of the first movie. This movie has a new setting, new situations, and the characters have grown since the first movie. I want to see what\'s happening with them and how their conflicts are going to be resolved. The drama is not only suspenseful, but it also makes sense. You can understand where all of this came from. It\'s pretty good to see these same characters who have changed and stretched and how they react to the new situations.While the movie is good, though, I have to say I was very unsatisfied. I don\'t know why, but I wasn\'t as invested in this movie as I was in the first movie. There are moments where the movie drags a bit, and that takes you out of the moment some. But my main problem is the ending. I\'m not too upset about Gavin dying, although that did come out of nowhere in a somewhat distasteful way. No, my trouble is with the following scene in the hospital. All of the couples are there soothing Pat, when she tells them to stop and turn to each other to fix their relationships.Now, first of all, I do understand what this is supposed to be. The message here is don\'t stay in the negativity and issues of your relationships, but rather fix the problems so you can spend your time in energy cherishing the other person and the relationship. That\'s a great and powerful message! What I don\'t like is how they do it. Like I said, Pat is crying, the characters are soothing her, and she tells them to stop and turn to each other and fix it. And that\'s exactly what they do! Just like that, they fix their problems! That\'s pretty weak! The genius of Tyler Perry\'s work is how well they reflect real life. This scene is more of something out of a fairy tale. If you want to show the other characters fix it, then let\'s see them fix it. Let\'s have them sit down and talk things out. Having that being said, I believe Marcus & Angela fixed their relationship. We saw them sit and have a conversation. I can sort of buy the Troy & Angela story because Troy worked things out with Mike, but we never saw him talk to Angela herself after the whole Mike situation. But what about Terry & Dianne? The last scene we saw with them ended so heavily; they never worked things out after that! Yeah, I don\'t like that.Finally, what was up with Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson\'s cameo at the end? That was really random and really pointless.True, the movie drags sometimes and the ending is weird, but besides that, I really like this movie. I think it\'s good, and it would been much better if the scenes didn\'t drag and the ending was more realistic. I still actually recommend this movie. It\'s not bad, but it could be better. Take a look at it. BOOYIKA!', ""How to begin? Well, TP must have asked that question as the first few scenes reintroduces all of the characters and a quasi time-line from the last movie. Like the first movie which focused on Sheila and Mike's marriage, this movie focuses on Patricia and Gavin. You'll see all sorts of normal marriage blunders, some with solutions, one without and one that explodes. Angela and husband provide comic relief to offset the drama.......and there is dark drama. This movie does not tie everything in nice neat, Hollywood ending and coupled with the dark drama, makes it very different from the first. If TP wants, there could be a third installment with a focus on another couple. There were two short scenes that should have been left on the editing floor, and the ending was characteristically rushed but beyond that, I enjoyed it. Oh, last gripe......I wish the funny lines weren't so close together, I missed some of them laughing at others. The audience laughed, gasped..and at times were very quiet. The acting was good, but I haven't seen Janet this good since she was Penny."", 'This movie is a great comedy for the family, couples, and even yourself. I saw the first movie a couple of months ago and loved it. I do have to admit that even though the first movie is not Oscar material, it is definitely romantic, lovely, and funny. I did not expected less from the the second part of the movie. If I compare this movie to ""Couples Retreat"" and other similar movies, ""Why Did I Get Married Too"" tops them all. It is extremely comical and it has very lovely scenes that teach you life lessons. It has many scenes that are not expected and thus lets the viewers very surprised.I am a very hard critic when it comes to movies. For me to give a 9/10 to this movie it is because it deserves. A movie worth watching that guarantees a good laugh and will make you think about marriage relationships in general. Thus far the best movie I\'ve seen in 2010. A must see movie for everyone!', ""I really liked this movie and everything about it. It was not predictable at all to me and very surprised by the ending. I really like that even when everyone seemed happy, they weren't perfect. That would have been annoying. Janet Jackson did an excellent job, which most of the emotion from her came from her brother passing away doing the making of the movie. Her role was believable and I loved it.I didn't like that the death of one of the cast members but I understand that it was needed in the movie. I love Tyler Perry and while this isn't my favorite movie by him it is a great movie in its own right. What more can I say other then I loved this movie and definitely cant wait until I buy it on DVD. Keep up the good work Mr. Perry, forget the nay sayers, and just keep doing great work. I will continue to buy all of your movies and plays if you keep doing that. LOVE!!! this movie. :-)"", 'This installment was even better than the first. It was obvious that Perry used Janet Jackson\'s grief over Michael Jackson\'s death in her performance, because she was 100% better in this flick than the original, showing much more emotion & actually squirting some tears! I wouldn\'t be surprised if Janet got some kinda nod for her performance even if she doesn\'t win. Overall this was a great movie with quite a few twists & surprises. Hated losing a beloved character, but looking forward to seeing how the surprise ending plays out in the third installment which I predict will be called ""Why Did I Get Married - Again!"" Go see it you won\'t be disappointed! All of the actors and actresses were excellent!', ""I thought this movie was great. My husband and I went and saw this together, and before we went into the movies we had been arguing, after the movie let out, we kissed and made up. This movie makes you appreciate life and the people in it. There are some very dramatic parts that make you stop and realize. I recommend this movie to any couple that has problems in their relationship. It opens up, and let's you understand both sides of the character's stories. There is a side of Janet Jackson in this movie that has never been seen before. People that are single may not appreciate the movie as much as a married couple would. The whole time during the movie me and my husband were looking at each other saying - yep you do that. Very realistic, and very entertaining. Definitely worth the money, and time."", ""First of all it is hard to even find the link on this site to this movie. WHY IS THAT?------I WONDER.As for the movie, I thoroughly enjoyed. It was both funny, sad, enlightening and dramatic!!! It is everything you want a movie to bed but bring your tissue with you. Tyler Perry's movie continue to get better each time and his method of producing drama shows the talent that is in this man. He is remarkable to say he wasn't Hollywood trained and all of that. Goes to show, Talent will rise to the top given the chance to shine. The audience in attendance when I saw it at lunch time (and it was a sellout) was shockingly diverse. I was glad to see that all races can appreciate TP's work. He proves that white America while go see a movie with an all black cast.I can promise you that you won't be disappointed if you go see this movie. You'll be like me, wanting to go see it again---which I am right now. Happy Popcorn!!!!"", 'I\'ve been watching Tyler Perry movies for a couple years now and I enjoy every one of them. He brings back humor along with emotional story-telling in his newest film.""Why did I get married too?"" is a very good follow-up to its predecessor. Here the main characters from the previous film go on another trip this time to the Bahamas. They have to deal with more marriage issues and even one of these couples won\'t make it. From the end of the first film we learned Shelia and Troy are married and right now they\'re dealing with the stress of moving and starting a family. While Mike shows up trying to win Shelia back after all that happened between them. Terry and Diane seem to have a good marriage going on except suspicion seems to be driving someone to the truth of their seemingly perfect marriage. Marcus and Angela are still arguing except this time its over Marcus\' new job as a sports caster and Angela is constantly thinking he\'s cheating and all that can happen is it could ruin their marriage before they can fix it. And finally Gavin and Patricia seem to be doing pretty good with there marriage after the events of the first film, however for all we know something could be happening that could drive them apart just like the others could be.

Directed by Jean Marc Valèe of last year\'s Dallas Buyers Club, I was going into this hoping for a brilliant film, instead I came away with great cinematography, an unbelievable Reese Witherspoon and misguided story that wants to be something more than ""a woman and the wilderness"" movie. Well, unfortunately, its not. Valèe seems to have exhausted his talents into last year\'s Dallas Buyers Club rather than into Wild. My problems with this film exude my likes, obviously but one thing about this film that I can\'t seem to shake is Witherspoon. I don\'t buy her as this character, she can\'t pass as a woman who is a drinker and a drug abuser because quite frankly, she looks terrible on screen doing these things. I don\'t buy it for a second, it is like watching a student film rehash of a better performance and cringing at how bad the student screws it up. The role of Cheryl was clearly meant for someone with a better range than Witherspoon. I\'m all for an actor to transform themselves to fit a film, much like McCounaghey did for Dallas Buyers. But Witherspoon seems so hesitant to do anything other than gain five pounds and not wear make-up for the entire film. No, it doesn\'t make it look like she has a drug and alcohol problem or is conflicted or is realistic, it just makes for a lazy performance and it is one I couldn\'t commit to for a two hour film. As far as the screenplay is concerned...well, what screenplay, it is mostly Reese Witherspoon trekking across the Pacific trail while reminiscing about past times and discovering dead end relationships along the way. It is a bare bones script from a bare bones book that was equally disappointing. However, the film may be boring and painfully slow, but the cinematography here was fantastic. There are some truly beautiful moments in this film regarding the way it looks. Outside Witherspoon, the supporting cast features Gabby Hoffman and Laura Dern and both of which deliver good performances. Overall, Wild features some great cinematography and a truly shoddy performance from Witherspoon. I can\'t begin to explain why she is being praised for taking off make up and walking on a trail for a two hour film. It isn\'t a brave performance, its a lazy one and an even lazier film. Wild is far from Sean Penn\'s Into the Wild, which I\'m sure will be the base of comparison and feels more like a half baked version of it.', 'A big disappointment, especially when considering the content of the book. Instead of focusing on the high adventure of her journey along the PCT, we are inundated continually with graphic depictions of her one night stands and heroin use. The film could have included her troubled past in an appropriate way, but did not. So if you enjoy nude scenes with druggies, watching losers shooting up and drugged out, and hearing the constant use of the F word, this is the film for you. Based on the book, Cheryl wanted to take this trip to seek a new identity and become the person that her mother wanted her to be. She adored her mother, who was depicted as being a wonderful person. However, even along the hike the film shows her possessing a dozen condoms and having a one night stand. The overuse of flashbacks take us away from the great adventure to graphic sex scenes she had with strangers. The audience reaction was obvious. At the beginning of her PCT trip the audience was jovial and into the adventure, but then the constant flashbacks of her morbid past brought the audience down. Even when we returned to the trail and something humorous would occur to Cheryl, the audience did not respond. The only ""uplifting"" portion of the film occurs in the last scene when she is shown standing on the bridge at the end of the journey reflecting on what a wonderful life she now has. Certainly, the trip depicted in the film did not lead to that final statement.', 'I always enjoyed Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern in other films but this was a total disappointment. It always goes back and forth between what happened and what is happening now. Then goes into sex, drugs and other past behavioral issues. The occasional funny moments don\'t make it worth sitting through. Scenery is great but I was just looking at my watch to see when it would end. That was the only thing I was looking forward to. A waste of time, money and visual experience. I came home and had Reese recorded on ""Pleasantville"". A great film with better acting and storyline. That and getting chocolate from RMC to bring home was the highlight of the experience this day.', ""When you have a film that is so heavily reliant on a single character, it's so important to make that character likable or relatable.I'm a big Reese Witherspoon fan and have been for a while, but I think she's got it all wrong in this film. Within a few minutes, I was already sick of the bad attitude and whining of her character. She turned up for a 1000 mile trek with 12 condoms, hardly any water and the wrong fuel for her stove.I didn't care about the character, and because of the way the films timeline is set out, you only get information in small flashbacks (which is annoying). This all means that you don't fully discover why this trek is being done until over an hour into the film. By that time I'd already mentally checked out and couldn't care less about the back story.I'm not certain what this film is supposed to be. It fails as a self-discovery film as the character who is supposed to be a recovering sex addict sleeps with one of the first guys she sees on the trek. It also fails as a survival movie as no less than 8 days into a 'character building wilderness trek' is our character hitching a ride back to a man's house to have a hot dinner and shower??? As with most reviewers, I can admit the scenery is beautiful and the film is reasonably well shot. Although I suppose they couldn't go too wrong with the PCT as a backdrop. But even the physical aspects of the film don't add up. Reese has no sun tan/burn after weeks in the baking sun. Her hair certainly doesn't resemble the hair of someone who has been trekking for weeks.I'm not an avid walker but I think I can bet my last dollar that the film is about as accurate to trekking as 'Vertical Limit' was to climbing.In the film's defence, it may be closely following the book that it is based upon. If that's the case, I sure as hell don't fancy reading the book."", ""There is nothing likable about Reese Witherspoon's character. She is constantly complaining, and has a permanent scowl on her face. Her attitude towards life is negative and selfish. From the first scene when she carelessly knocks her boot off the edge of the cliff and throws the other one - I shook my head. She goes through that whole walk without finding any meaning, just feeling sorry for herself and not thinking carefully about what she is doing. Because she has no idea about hiking or camping, she ends up asking men for help and then thinking that they all want to sleep with her, which they don't, but that's her bad attitude for you.I'd have to say my favourite part of the film was when the older man empties her pack for her. She brought random things without thinking through what she really needed, all the while I just want to slap that scowl off her face."", ""This was a really, really bad film. And furthermore, it was a really bad adaptation of a fairly decent book. The plot plays out like someone is having acid flashbacks while doing a hike. This movie was slow, corny, annoying, disjointed, boring.... It has some really good names tied to it - Reece, Nick Hornby (come on Nick!), Jean Marc Vallee, Laura Dern, Cheryl Strayed.... but what a ripe mess! Don't even get me started on the soundtrack, or the CGI fox.If you want to watch a good movie about solo adventures, check out: 1. Tracks 2. Into the Wild 3. 127 Hours 4. Life of Pi 5. Castaway. And only watch this B-movie if you want to see an example of how NOT to adapt an adventure narrative to film."", ""this was suppose to Reese big comeback to the serious movies, Which I guess is why they put in all the nudity there.(She looks great though, for being 40+ and a mum) The landscape scenery is just fantastic at times, but always get interrupted by annoying flashbacks from her childhood or misspent youth. Which was just annoying as can be. you don't feel anything for her character, cause her background is all scrambled in flashbacks. A Little bit here a little bit there. The music in the movie, was kind of annoying. It wasn't really needed, and it didn't really fit.When you gonna walk the Mojave desert I would expect you to have a sunscreen and sunglasses, not to mention drink a lot of water. Yet the only time we see Reese drink is when she's at the rest stops along the trail, which is supposedly few and far between. She also get no sunburn which is strange, considering she wear shorts and t-shirt all the time. But she get a heavy pack. rash. which they use every opportunity they can to show off. The problem is Reese as a trail walker isn't believable, she just can't convince me that she's the type, she always look to damn perfect. Her hair is always straight and groomed. Her make up is always perfect. It makes me wonder, have these people ever seen backpackers outside of travel magazines? They are usually filthy and dirty and their hair is a mess. Reese hasn't one strain of hair out of place. The only sign she's been walking in the desert heat, are some dust in her face She also seem to have very little direction. Considering it some sort of a famous hiking trail, I would assume its pretty good market. Especially when you think of all the 1000 of people, whom must have walked ahead of her, and who must have hiked it before. Yet Reese, seem to walk all over the place.There was a scene midway into the movie, that made no sense at all. A man who stand on the street corner in some town delivering flyer's to passers by, comes over to talk to her. And suddenly she's afraid of him and start backing up, even though he's far outside her personal space and they're in the middle of a public street. At first I thought she knew him from her past. But as it turned out, they were complete stranger to each other"", 'Strayed is difficult to like so we never bond with or particularly pull for her. A lot of people have hiked the PCT, and a lot of people have experienced tough times, but why do we care that somebody turned her life into a heroin and promiscuity-filled train wreck, then hiked? There was no reason to bond with the main character.And I don\'t buy the portrayal of the park ranger who tries to leave her in the pouring rain instead of letting her in the door 20 feet away unless she does him favors, then makes another advance with three other hikers around. Really? Men are generally portrayed in this film as puckish clowns or sexual predators. Consider the source - a head case hiker armed with a bunch of condoms and a beast-with-two-backs habit. In reality most people one meets along the PCT have nature in mind. I guess we\'re seeing it from her perspective.More interesting would have been a documentary on the PCT or another episode of ""Intervention"" with Strayed as the focus. Largely absent was the beauty of the PCT and any reason to bond with any of the characters.Not terrible but no real reason to see it. Could have been titled ""Horny Head Case Ex-Heroin Addict Adulterer With Foul Attitude and Potty Mouth Takes Time to Process Painful Memories That Many People Experience - While Hiking the Pacific Crest Trail"", but I suppose ""Wild"" fits the marquee better. Whatever. And the fox was blatantly CGI.', ""I like Reese Whiterspoon, I think she's great.However, this movie is just so incredible boring. I ended up fast forwarding through most of it.It's about a girl in her 30s that has gone through an emotional ordeal. To get back on her feet she decides to walk from Mexico to Canada without any experience walking at all.For hikers this movie is going to be a joke. For me, it's just mildly entertaining in its attempt to depict possible problems that arise from walking.In the end, this movie is not worth seeing if you don't completely adore Reese Whiterspoon and has seen every single movie she has starred in. Sorry but this movie is not for me."", 'For the last couple years hiking on the PCT, I have heard about the book the Wild mainly from non-hikers. I curiously watched this to see what the fuss was about. My experience on the trail was vastly different from the portrayal in the movie. Strayed was very inexperienced and most of the drama stems from that. Also most PCT hikers only really worry about the next water source, getting in their miles, and the next resupply stop.I felt the movie did not really capture the every day life of a PCT hiker very well brushing over common hiker dialog and every day tasks. I will note that backpacking has changed a lot since Strayed hiked. The gear is lighter, we use trail runners instead of hiking boots, trekking poles, and the trail is more popular which is good and bad. The most off putting aspect for someone who has hiked the trail before is the locations and terrain vary greatly from the actual trail. Sometimes I felt that Strayed got lost her entire hike climbing over rocks at Smith Rock in Oregon. Aka the PCT is graded for horses. What was she doing? For someone who would like to watch this movie and recreate great memories, I found it very difficult. The simplest way to explain it is her experience depresses my experience. The real trail is far greater than the movie depicts. The solo hiking women I have met on trail are very strong, independent, and are more than capable of taking care of themselves in the wild. There are people I have met on trail with disabilities and amazing life stories that I think would have made a better movie.', 'Interesting topic for a self-discovery film that was done very badly. Way too many Hollywood BS ""production values"" and no personal revelations influenced by the glorious nature surrounding Sheryl(Reese W.)with every step she took. She hardly even noticed it except for the possible hardship it caused her! Awful, just awful. And, it was laughable that she decided on taking her ""grieving"" hike due to a trail guide she saw in a shop! Nothing more intelligent or insightful than that. This movie was that dumb, and Sheryl too if that was the true reason.Also, it\'s hard to feel sorry for a grown woman who took to careless and casual sexual train-pulling and drugs to deal with her mother\'s death. What? I lost total interest when it was clear that she had not learned anything belief-enhancing from her trek when she instantly jumped into the sack on a one night stand with some guy she met in the course of her hike. Classy broad, not, and one obviously very damaged by her terrible life choices. And, no signs those bad choices would get any better.And, the ending, what epiphany chances lost! The movie just ended at the end of the hike, with no clue of any insights or lessons learned or even if her grief was better.The theater where I saw this film had the sound so low everyone was complaining that they could not hear the dialog(lots of mumbling), and that negative surely affected this review. The cinematography and scenery were great, but that scenery was unused by Sheryl as a conscious pathway to discovery. She was more concerned with the miles she was logging(slogging)than any scenery. Reese did an OK job playing this broken woman with whom I had little sympathy, as she seemed to learn little from her trek but that it was hard, demanding and finally finished, but Laura Dern was much better as her loving and slightly batty mother. Really good. Too bad she was the one who died.So sorry my wife talked me into seeing this misguided ""effort"" as it was obviously a movie done only for money, and not for the desire to share any personal revelations that may have been spiritually rewarding or may have led to personal growth and change in Sheryl\'s damaged life perspective. We didn\'t see even one indication of that by the end! Of course, that would have required some brainpower and sensitivity. Only the money people\'s(Reese was one)motivation of ""Get those ticket paying butts in the seats! Hey, Reese is so cute""...........was the real motivation behind this loser that could have been so much more in different hands.', 'Reese Witherspoon is good in this movie but not great by any means and I happen to be a fan of hers. The movie is directed in a fragmented way that does not serve the story in any way. We cannot get to know this woman --her journey from the lowest depths to some sort of epiphany because to this fragmentation. We are kept at a distance from her transformation by the choice of the director. And it hampers the development of the character. There is no way into this movie and ultimately it becomes tedious. There is no depth and not enough character development for us to care about this woman\'s journey. The supporting cast also suffers from this fragmentation. In every way it lacks the intensity and realism that the directory brought to DALLAS BUYERS CLUB. You won\'t find that kind of honesty in this film. Many scenes seem almost ""stock"".', 'I am really surprised at all of the negative reviews here. But then I remember, this is IMDb. Enough said there. I enjoyed this movie very much. I don\'t think it was anything more than the story of one woman trying to find a way to move forward. This movie is not a political statement about feminism. This is ONE woman\'s story of regret, healing, and ultimately about forgiving herself so that she could move forward. Is this movie boring? Only if you need CGI and superheroes to call it ""exciting."" Do people do really adventurous things like taking off alone on a thousand mile trek on foot? Yeah, they do. And most of them actually survive. People have been surviving for thousands of years by striking out on their own without any previous experience or ""training."" Many years ago I did something very similar to what this woman did in the Sierra Nevadas. Looking back now I know I must have been crazy to do something so unplanned. But it was something I felt I had to do and was also stemmed from a tragic loss. I thought Reese was very believable in this role. The constant flashbacks that seemed to bother all the other reviewers did not bother me in the least. The flashbacks were the unfolding of her life taken in little pieces and in sync with the memories that were ignited within her on her journey. So contrary to the other reviewers, I liked this movie! The soundtrack was right on target with what was happening in each scene. The scenery was stunning, but of course it would be if you\'ve ever been in the area. On foot. I happily gave this movie a rating of 7 out of 10.', ""Wild has a really intriguing premise, the idea of a solo hike does it for me but I was wary that the movie lasted over 100min. What could possibly be entertaining about a women hiking alone from the Mexican border to the Canadian Border? As it turns out quite a lot.At first, it's hard to understand Cheryl, she definitely does not strike you as a someone who could do this. She bit off more than she can shew, it's clearly naive of her. But as Cheryl is struggling on her hike flashbacks of her life before the Pacific Crest Trails are peppered throughout the movie and like anyone you're getting to know she starts to make sense. You get to understand what she's been through, who she is, and what motivated her to do this. It's a challenge that she brought on herself for herself, something she needed.And just like that a 115 minutes passes, during which you were taken on physical and soul searching journey with amazing landscapes, and a flawed but strong woman. Reese Witherspoon carries that film beautifully, she layered her performance with sensibility and a quiet strength that suited the character. I didn't totally relate to Cheryl but I wasn't completely impervious to her ordeal, I also have dreams and life-goals to achieve.On a side note, it was recently pointed out to me I had never seen Wild as the female lead version of Into The Wild. I've never finished Sean Penn & Emile Hirsh's hiking movie but from what I remember Into The Wild was much more wild and raw the dude wasn't on a hiking trail but in the wilderness. These two movies only compare in the drives these two characters have to undertake their journey.Wild is a beautiful movie about personal growth and living in one's truth. @wornoutspines"", 'Your life will most likely determine whether or not you like this film, whether or not it moves you.I read the book and was not sure how they were going to make such an introspective novel into a movie but they did a pretty good job. My group of friends had mixed reactions, some of us were deeply moved (myself included) some where wondering why we were...I felt the way her story was portrayed in flashbacks was very effective and about the only way to tell this story. It can never be as deep as the emotions in the book and it had to skim over a lot but still, for me and others I was with it was very powerful.On a superficial side note... I wish she had looked dirtier. Her hair and clothes always looked too clean for what she was doing with very minimal hygiene.', 'A wonderful performance from Reese Witherspoon anchors this very good film about a troubled young woman who embarks on a miles-long hike as a sort of personal therapy to deal with the downward spiral of her life in the wake of her mother\'s (Laura Dern) death. Witherspoon reminds everyone what a good actress she is; I haven\'t been this impressed by her as an actress since ""Election"" way back in 1999 (and that includes her overrated Oscar-winning performance in ""Walk the Line""). And it\'s nice to see Laura Dern again, who\'s popped up here and there over the past many years but has mostly been absent from the movie scene. The movie\'s editor deftly integrates flashbacks of Dern and Witherspoon together with the character\'s hike through the wild, and avoids the monotony that usually plagues films when structured this way.One of the minor miracles of ""Wild"" is how subtly it explores not just the trials and dangers one would encounter in such a hike, but specifically how those trials and dangers are heightened, or at least are of a different nature, for a woman. Only once in the film is it overtly addressed, but before that scene late in the film, the director and Witherspoon have already conveyed without words how perilous such an adventure could be for a young woman, for whom every encounter with a strange man carries with it the possibility of sexual predation, even if it doesn\'t materialize (which, the film acknowledges, in most cases it doesn\'t). At the same time, the film restores one\'s faith a little bit in humanity, suggesting that most people are decent and kind and willing to help, no strings attached.Witherspoon and Dern were both justly Oscar nominated for their performances, and the gorgeous Pacific West scenery deserved an award of its own.Grade: A', 'The poet Rilke said ""There is only one journey. Going inside yourself. Here something blooms; from out of a silent crevice, an unknowing weed emerges singing into existence."" That unknowing weed sings loud and clear in Jean Marc Vallée\'s (Dallas Buyer\'s Club) Wild, the story of 26-year-old Cheryl Strayed\'s 1,000 mile hike along the Pacific Crest Trail in 1995 in an attempt to redeem a troubled past. Unlike John Curran\'s Tracks which documented naturalist Robyn Davidson\'s grueling nine-month journey through the Australian outback, Wild is more of an inward-looking psychological drama than a physical adventure, but it has enough of both to keep us focused.Based on a best-selling memoir, Wild stars Reese Witherspoon as Strayed, who hikes through deserts and mountains from California to Washington, pushing herself to the limit of her physical and mental strength. It is Witherspoon\'s best performance in years and is likely to raise Oscar speculation. From the beginning when Cheryl takes off her hiking boots to show us socks dripping with blood from a ""disengaged"" toenail, we know that we are not in for a pleasant walk in the park. Additional physical hardships lurk, waiting to spring. While lugging around a thousand- pound backpack dubbed ""The Monster,"" a metaphor for the ""baggage"" she carries around with her, Strayed has to face running out of water, confronting unfriendly rattlesnakes, and avoiding threatening encounters with some good ol\' boys that remind her that, as a woman traveling by herself, she faces risks most men would not.Most of the film, however, centers on numerous flashbacks to Cheryl\'s childhood memories and they are not always pleasant. We see snippets of her recollection of the traumas she faced when growing up – her life with an abusive, alcoholic father, the death of her adored mother Bobbi (Laura Dern) from cancer at the age of 45, and her subsequent freefall into heroin addiction, promiscuous sex, and failed marriages. As she passes the trail logs that dot the route, Cheryl enters short pithy comments that reflect her emotional state at the moment such as ""God is a ruthless bitch,"" quotes that join other artists and poets such as Walt Whitman, Emily Dickenson, and Joni Mitchell.Relying on her innate skill, her odyssey is not an exercise in self-flagellation, but a way to reach for a new sense of self, a point where she is able to forgive herself and others. While the film displays much positive energy, there is also a sense of emotional overload that often feels calculated and straining for profundity where understatement would have worked better. The film is also not well served by a pointless meeting with a black reporter from the Hobo Times, and by shameless commercial tie-ins with Snapple and REI, (which Cheryl praises as the best corporation ever).In spite of its flaws, however, Vallée keeps the clichés manageable while the richly expressive performances of Witherspoon and Dern, the poetic sounds of Simon and Garfunkel\'s El Condor Pasa, and a memorable rendition of Red River Valley from a most unlikely source, combine to rescue Wild from its flirtation with banality and turn Cheryl\'s dark journey into an empowering transformation.', ""This was a great movie and exactly what I needed! I know from now on to not listen to most of the reviews on here at all. They are the opposite of good!? This was along the lines of Into The Wild, not as good but not bad at all and worth watching.

She turned up for a 1000 mile trek with 12 condoms, hardly any water and the wrong fuel for her stove.I didn't care about the character, and because of the way the films timeline is set out, you only get information in small flashbacks (which is annoying). This all means that you don't fully discover why this trek is being done until over an hour into the film. By that time I'd already mentally checked out and couldn't care less about the back story.I'm not certain what this film is supposed to be. It fails as a self-discovery film as the character who is supposed to be a recovering sex addict sleeps with one of the first guys she sees on the trek. It also fails as a survival movie as no less than 8 days into a 'character building wilderness trek' is our character hitching a ride back to a man's house to have a hot dinner and shower??? As with most reviewers, I can admit the scenery is beautiful and the film is reasonably well shot. Although I suppose they couldn't go too wrong with the PCT as a backdrop. But even the physical aspects of the film don't add up. Reese has no sun tan/burn after weeks in the baking sun. Her hair certainly doesn't resemble the hair of someone who has been trekking for weeks.I'm not an avid walker but I think I can bet my last dollar that the film is about as accurate to trekking as 'Vertical Limit' was to climbing.In the film's defence, it may be closely following the book that it is based upon. If that's the case, I sure as hell don't fancy reading the book."", ""There is nothing likable about Reese Witherspoon's character. She is constantly complaining, and has a permanent scowl on her face. Her attitude towards life is negative and selfish. From the first scene when she carelessly knocks her boot off the edge of the cliff and throws the other one - I shook my head. She goes through that whole walk without finding any meaning, just feeling sorry for herself and not thinking carefully about what she is doing. Because she has no idea about hiking or camping, she ends up asking men for help and then thinking that they all want to sleep with her, which they don't, but that's her bad attitude for you.I'd have to say my favourite part of the film was when the older man empties her pack for her. She brought random things without thinking through what she really needed, all the while I just want to slap that scowl off her face."", ""This was a really, really bad film. And furthermore, it was a really bad adaptation of a fairly decent book. The plot plays out like someone is having acid flashbacks while doing a hike. This movie was slow, corny, annoying, disjointed, boring.... It has some really good names tied to it - Reece, Nick Hornby (come on Nick!), Jean Marc Vallee, Laura Dern, Cheryl Strayed.... but what a ripe mess! Don't even get me started on the soundtrack, or the CGI fox.If you want to watch a good movie about solo adventures, check out: 1. Tracks 2. Into the Wild 3. 127 Hours 4. Life of Pi 5. Castaway. And only watch this B-movie if you want to see an example of how NOT to adapt an adventure narrative to film."", ""this was suppose to Reese big comeback to the serious movies, Which I guess is why they put in all the nudity there.(She looks great though, for being 40+ and a mum) The landscape scenery is just fantastic at times, but always get interrupted by annoying flashbacks from her childhood or misspent youth. Which was just annoying as can be. you don't feel anything for her character, cause her background is all scrambled in flashbacks. A Little bit here a little bit there. The music in the movie, was kind of annoying. It wasn't really needed, and it didn't really fit.When you gonna walk the Mojave desert I would expect you to have a sunscreen and sunglasses, not to mention drink a lot of water. Yet the only time we see Reese drink is when she's at the rest stops along the trail, which is supposedly few and far between. She also get no sunburn which is strange, considering she wear shorts and t-shirt all the time. But she get a heavy pack. rash. which they use every opportunity they can to show off. The problem is Reese as a trail walker isn't believable, she just can't convince me that she's the type, she always look to damn perfect. Her hair is always straight and groomed. Her make up is always perfect. It makes me wonder, have these people ever seen backpackers outside of travel magazines? They are usually filthy and dirty and their hair is a mess. Reese hasn't one strain of hair out of place. The only sign she's been walking in the desert heat, are some dust in her face She also seem to have very little direction. Considering it some sort of a famous hiking trail, I would assume its pretty good market. Especially when you think of all the 1000 of people, whom must have walked ahead of her, and who must have hiked it before. Yet Reese, seem to walk all over the place.There was a scene midway into the movie, that made no sense at all. A man who stand on the street corner in some town delivering flyer's to passers by, comes over to talk to her. And suddenly she's afraid of him and start backing up, even though he's far outside her personal space and they're in the middle of a public street. At first I thought she knew him from her past. But as it turned out, they were complete stranger to each other"", 'Strayed is difficult to like so we never bond with or particularly pull for her. A lot of people have hiked the PCT, and a lot of people have experienced tough times, but why do we care that somebody turned her life into a heroin and promiscuity-filled train wreck, then hiked? There was no reason to bond with the main character.And I don\'t buy the portrayal of the park ranger who tries to leave her in the pouring rain instead of letting her in the door 20 feet away unless she does him favors, then makes another advance with three other hikers around. Really? Men are generally portrayed in this film as puckish clowns or sexual predators. Consider the source - a head case hiker armed with a bunch of condoms and a beast-with-two-backs habit. In reality most people one meets along the PCT have nature in mind. I guess we\'re seeing it from her perspective.More interesting would have been a documentary on the PCT or another episode of ""Intervention"" with Strayed as the focus. Largely absent was the beauty of the PCT and any reason to bond with any of the characters.Not terrible but no real reason to see it. Could have been titled ""Horny Head Case Ex-Heroin Addict Adulterer With Foul Attitude and Potty Mouth Takes Time to Process Painful Memories That Many People Experience - While Hiking the Pacific Crest Trail"", but I suppose ""Wild"" fits the marquee better. Whatever. And the fox was blatantly CGI.', ""I like Reese Whiterspoon, I think she's great.However, this movie is just so incredible boring. I ended up fast forwarding through most of it.It's about a girl in her 30s that has gone through an emotional ordeal. To get back on her feet she decides to walk from Mexico to Canada without any experience walking at all.For hikers this movie is going to be a joke. For me, it's just mildly entertaining in its attempt to depict possible problems that arise from walking.In the end, this movie is not worth seeing if you don't completely adore Reese Whiterspoon and has seen every single movie she has starred in. Sorry but this movie is not for me."", 'For the last couple years hiking on the PCT, I have heard about the book the Wild mainly from non-hikers. I curiously watched this to see what the fuss was about. My experience on the trail was vastly different from the portrayal in the movie. Strayed was very inexperienced and most of the drama stems from that. Also most PCT hikers only really worry about the next water source, getting in their miles, and the next resupply stop.I felt the movie did not really capture the every day life of a PCT hiker very well brushing over common hiker dialog and every day tasks. I will note that backpacking has changed a lot since Strayed hiked. The gear is lighter, we use trail runners instead of hiking boots, trekking poles, and the trail is more popular which is good and bad. The most off putting aspect for someone who has hiked the trail before is the locations and terrain vary greatly from the actual trail. Sometimes I felt that Strayed got lost her entire hike climbing over rocks at Smith Rock in Oregon. Aka the PCT is graded for horses. What was she doing? For someone who would like to watch this movie and recreate great memories, I found it very difficult. The simplest way to explain it is her experience depresses my experience. The real trail is far greater than the movie depicts. The solo hiking women I have met on trail are very strong, independent, and are more than capable of taking care of themselves in the wild. There are people I have met on trail with disabilities and amazing life stories that I think would have made a better movie.', 'Interesting topic for a self-discovery film that was done very badly. Way too many Hollywood BS ""production values"" and no personal revelations influenced by the glorious nature surrounding Sheryl(Reese W.)with every step she took. She hardly even noticed it except for the possible hardship it caused her! Awful, just awful. And, it was laughable that she decided on taking her ""grieving"" hike due to a trail guide she saw in a shop! Nothing more intelligent or insightful than that. This movie was that dumb, and Sheryl too if that was the true reason.Also, it\'s hard to feel sorry for a grown woman who took to careless and casual sexual train-pulling and drugs to deal with her mother\'s death. What? I lost total interest when it was clear that she had not learned anything belief-enhancing from her trek when she instantly jumped into the sack on a one night stand with some guy she met in the course of her hike. Classy broad, not, and one obviously very damaged by her terrible life choices. And, no signs those bad choices would get any better.And, the ending, what epiphany chances lost! The movie just ended at the end of the hike, with no clue of any insights or lessons learned or even if her grief was better.The theater where I saw this film had the sound so low everyone was complaining that they could not hear the dialog(lots of mumbling), and that negative surely affected this review. The cinematography and scenery were great, but that scenery was unused by Sheryl as a conscious pathway to discovery. She was more concerned with the miles she was logging(slogging)than any scenery. Reese did an OK job playing this broken woman with whom I had little sympathy, as she seemed to learn little from her trek but that it was hard, demanding and finally finished, but Laura Dern was much better as her loving and slightly batty mother. Really good. Too bad she was the one who died.So sorry my wife talked me into seeing this misguided ""effort"" as it was obviously a movie done only for money, and not for the desire to share any personal revelations that may have been spiritually rewarding or may have led to personal growth and change in Sheryl\'s damaged life perspective. We didn\'t see even one indication of that by the end! Of course, that would have required some brainpower and sensitivity. Only the money people\'s(Reese was one)motivation of ""Get those ticket paying butts in the seats! Hey, Reese is so cute""...........was the real motivation behind this loser that could have been so much more in different hands.', 'Reese Witherspoon is good in this movie but not great by any means and I happen to be a fan of hers. The movie is directed in a fragmented way that does not serve the story in any way. We cannot get to know this woman --her journey from the lowest depths to some sort of epiphany because to this fragmentation. We are kept at a distance from her transformation by the choice of the director. And it hampers the development of the character. There is no way into this movie and ultimately it becomes tedious. There is no depth and not enough character development for us to care about this woman\'s journey. The supporting cast also suffers from this fragmentation. In every way it lacks the intensity and realism that the directory brought to DALLAS BUYERS CLUB. You won\'t find that kind of honesty in this film. Many scenes seem almost ""stock"".', 'I am really surprised at all of the negative reviews here. But then I remember, this is IMDb. Enough said there. I enjoyed this movie very much. I don\'t think it was anything more than the story of one woman trying to find a way to move forward. This movie is not a political statement about feminism. This is ONE woman\'s story of regret, healing, and ultimately about forgiving herself so that she could move forward. Is this movie boring? Only if you need CGI and superheroes to call it ""exciting."" Do people do really adventurous things like taking off alone on a thousand mile trek on foot? Yeah, they do. And most of them actually survive. People have been surviving for thousands of years by striking out on their own without any previous experience or ""training."" Many years ago I did something very similar to what this woman did in the Sierra Nevadas. Looking back now I know I must have been crazy to do something so unplanned. But it was something I felt I had to do and was also stemmed from a tragic loss. I thought Reese was very believable in this role. The constant flashbacks that seemed to bother all the other reviewers did not bother me in the least. The flashbacks were the unfolding of her life taken in little pieces and in sync with the memories that were ignited within her on her journey. So contrary to the other reviewers, I liked this movie! The soundtrack was right on target with what was happening in each scene. The scenery was stunning, but of course it would be if you\'ve ever been in the area. On foot. I happily gave this movie a rating of 7 out of 10.', ""Wild has a really intriguing premise, the idea of a solo hike does it for me but I was wary that the movie lasted over 100min. What could possibly be entertaining about a women hiking alone from the Mexican border to the Canadian Border? As it turns out quite a lot.At first, it's hard to understand Cheryl, she definitely does not strike you as a someone who could do this. She bit off more than she can shew, it's clearly naive of her. But as Cheryl is struggling on her hike flashbacks of her life before the Pacific Crest Trails are peppered throughout the movie and like anyone you're getting to know she starts to make sense. You get to understand what she's been through, who she is, and what motivated her to do this. It's a challenge that she brought on herself for herself, something she needed.And just like that a 115 minutes passes, during which you were taken on physical and soul searching journey with amazing landscapes, and a flawed but strong woman. Reese Witherspoon carries that film beautifully, she layered her performance with sensibility and a quiet strength that suited the character. I didn't totally relate to Cheryl but I wasn't completely impervious to her ordeal, I also have dreams and life-goals to achieve.On a side note, it was recently pointed out to me I had never seen Wild as the female lead version of Into The Wild. I've never finished Sean Penn & Emile Hirsh's hiking movie but from what I remember Into The Wild was much more wild and raw the dude wasn't on a hiking trail but in the wilderness. These two movies only compare in the drives these two characters have to undertake their journey.Wild is a beautiful movie about personal growth and living in one's truth. @wornoutspines"", 'Your life will most likely determine whether or not you like this film, whether or not it moves you.I read the book and was not sure how they were going to make such an introspective novel into a movie but they did a pretty good job. My group of friends had mixed reactions, some of us were deeply moved (myself included) some where wondering why we were...I felt the way her story was portrayed in flashbacks was very effective and about the only way to tell this story. It can never be as deep as the emotions in the book and it had to skim over a lot but still, for me and others I was with it was very powerful.On a superficial side note... I wish she had looked dirtier. Her hair and clothes always looked too clean for what she was doing with very minimal hygiene.', 'A wonderful performance from Reese Witherspoon anchors this very good film about a troubled young woman who embarks on a miles-long hike as a sort of personal therapy to deal with the downward spiral of her life in the wake of her mother\'s (Laura Dern) death. Witherspoon reminds everyone what a good actress she is; I haven\'t been this impressed by her as an actress since ""Election"" way back in 1999 (and that includes her overrated Oscar-winning performance in ""Walk the Line""). And it\'s nice to see Laura Dern again, who\'s popped up here and there over the past many years but has mostly been absent from the movie scene. The movie\'s editor deftly integrates flashbacks of Dern and Witherspoon together with the character\'s hike through the wild, and avoids the monotony that usually plagues films when structured this way.One of the minor miracles of ""Wild"" is how subtly it explores not just the trials and dangers one would encounter in such a hike, but specifically how those trials and dangers are heightened, or at least are of a different nature, for a woman. Only once in the film is it overtly addressed, but before that scene late in the film, the director and Witherspoon have already conveyed without words how perilous such an adventure could be for a young woman, for whom every encounter with a strange man carries with it the possibility of sexual predation, even if it doesn\'t materialize (which, the film acknowledges, in most cases it doesn\'t). At the same time, the film restores one\'s faith a little bit in humanity, suggesting that most people are decent and kind and willing to help, no strings attached.Witherspoon and Dern were both justly Oscar nominated for their performances, and the gorgeous Pacific West scenery deserved an award of its own.Grade: A', 'The poet Rilke said ""There is only one journey. Going inside yourself. Here something blooms; from out of a silent crevice, an unknowing weed emerges singing into existence."" That unknowing weed sings loud and clear in Jean Marc Vallée\'s (Dallas Buyer\'s Club) Wild, the story of 26-year-old Cheryl Strayed\'s 1,000 mile hike along the Pacific Crest Trail in 1995 in an attempt to redeem a troubled past. Unlike John Curran\'s Tracks which documented naturalist Robyn Davidson\'s grueling nine-month journey through the Australian outback, Wild is more of an inward-looking psychological drama than a physical adventure, but it has enough of both to keep us focused.Based on a best-selling memoir, Wild stars Reese Witherspoon as Strayed, who hikes through deserts and mountains from California to Washington, pushing herself to the limit of her physical and mental strength. It is Witherspoon\'s best performance in years and is likely to raise Oscar speculation. From the beginning when Cheryl takes off her hiking boots to show us socks dripping with blood from a ""disengaged"" toenail, we know that we are not in for a pleasant walk in the park. Additional physical hardships lurk, waiting to spring. While lugging around a thousand- pound backpack dubbed ""The Monster,"" a metaphor for the ""baggage"" she carries around with her, Strayed has to face running out of water, confronting unfriendly rattlesnakes, and avoiding threatening encounters with some good ol\' boys that remind her that, as a woman traveling by herself, she faces risks most men would not.Most of the film, however, centers on numerous flashbacks to Cheryl\'s childhood memories and they are not always pleasant. We see snippets of her recollection of the traumas she faced when growing up – her life with an abusive, alcoholic father, the death of her adored mother Bobbi (Laura Dern) from cancer at the age of 45, and her subsequent freefall into heroin addiction, promiscuous sex, and failed marriages. As she passes the trail logs that dot the route, Cheryl enters short pithy comments that reflect her emotional state at the moment such as ""God is a ruthless bitch,"" quotes that join other artists and poets such as Walt Whitman, Emily Dickenson, and Joni Mitchell.Relying on her innate skill, her odyssey is not an exercise in self-flagellation, but a way to reach for a new sense of self, a point where she is able to forgive herself and others. While the film displays much positive energy, there is also a sense of emotional overload that often feels calculated and straining for profundity where understatement would have worked better. The film is also not well served by a pointless meeting with a black reporter from the Hobo Times, and by shameless commercial tie-ins with Snapple and REI, (which Cheryl praises as the best corporation ever).In spite of its flaws, however, Vallée keeps the clichés manageable while the richly expressive performances of Witherspoon and Dern, the poetic sounds of Simon and Garfunkel\'s El Condor Pasa, and a memorable rendition of Red River Valley from a most unlikely source, combine to rescue Wild from its flirtation with banality and turn Cheryl\'s dark journey into an empowering transformation.', ""This was a great movie and exactly what I needed!

The pace is so sluggish it often seems more like a rough cut than a finished film. And the female lead - Mrs Duval - gives the most amateurish performance seen in a Hollywood release in some decades. Mr Duval does his usual taciturn schtick to absolutely zero effect. And only James Franco seems to be investing his role with some genuine emotion and enthusiasm - perhaps in the misguided belief that it might be worth the effort.

The man is a very fine actor, no one could deny that, but perhaps writing and directing are simply not for him if 'Wild Horses' is anything to go by. The script in particular is an absolute mess. The dialogue often feels like it's been written for a 5 year-old and by a 5 year-old. The story is told in incredibly clunky fashion and none of the intended 'heavy' scenes have any effect whatsoever on the audience.The directing is not much better. The actors all look completely lost in every scene. There's some very strange casting with the likes of Josh Hartnett and James Franco, but the strangest of all was Luciana Pedraza. She was so unbelievably bad in her performance I had to look up her IMDb profile just to see who exactly the hell she was - only to find she was in fact Duvall's sister-in-law, sigh! I can't imagine any other filmmaker being willing to cast her and yet I notice Duvall also cast her in his 2002 film 'Assasination Tango'. Perhaps he just makes a film every ten years or so with a role written specifically for her so she can pay some bills. Who knows, but it's really not a good look. An awful performance in an awful film. Nothing to see here."", ""This movie is unfortunately a turkey and or a lemon. Everything about it is just plain horrible: the acting, the story line, the script and above all: the directing.

Well at least the Razzie Awards will most likely have a field day on which categories this stinker could be up for. How 'bout going for a grand slam? New Razzie world record perhaps?

I am 'so sad' that the actors chosen to play the Rangers were so horrible, that even they must cry themselves to sleep at night for being so devoid of talent. Sadly, its not just those actors, but also the timing in the dialogue along with multiple directing errors; it was to the point that even changing scenes seemed to be an impossible feat. Josh did amazingly well considering the circumstances, but it is sad to see that an actor of his caliber was convinced to do this movie. Duvall did well in regards to his acting (in a way I would expect, as a fan of his), but by Duvall producing and directing this...I don't think we will see him again anytime soon.

Despite having a few other well known names in the shape of Franco and Hartnett most of the story is told via Pedraza/Duvall's female Ranger and she's just not a good enough actress to carry the film and gives a very wooden and stilted performance which becomes annoying . On top of that the film moves at a very slow pace which made me think the director was copying wholesale the Coens' style from NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN . Unlike that film WILD HORSES is far from compelling and feels like two separate stories , one featuring a crime drama and one featuring a angst ridden family drama stuck together in a rather unsatisfying manner and means we're left with an unsatisfying film"", ""Those seeking for a detective movie might be disappointed. Wild Horses is first and foremost a family drama, while the investigation part takes secondary priority. It provides solid emotional scenes, mainly thanks to the veteran cast and the personal premise, although the pace is unfortunately slow. It may not appeal to anyone since it will take nearly an hour before the momentum actually builds up, furthermore the crime element is considerably weak.Story follows the sheriff from small desert town who opens a cold case concerning a missing boy. It happened fifteen years ago, so understandably it rattles some people, especially the Briggs family. It becomes clear early on that Luciana Pedraza as the sheriff is not in the same league as the rest of the cast, which is unfortunate since her perspective, while not in the same volume of the family's, is still crucial to the plot.Additionally, there is very thin material for the crime aspect, it could have been skimped to minor subplot, yet the movie invests quite a lot on the police angle. The rest of the time is focused on dialogues in the Briggs family. The Briggs are very rich family and very patriarchy, they also harbors a lot of secrets. Duvall plays as Scott, the head of the family and he delivers a very convincing performance. He keeps the interest of his family first, although this might collide with the tragedy of the past.Josh Hartnett has added depth on his character. He looks straightforward or rigid, but can also be passionately aggressive. The youngest son Ben is played by James Franco and he might be hust the nicest and honest amongst all. Between the three of them the acting is highly presentable, but since the screenplay consists of slow pace conversations, it can be tedious at times.It has the good intention on delivering very private issue by the perspective of an entire family.

Without a doubt, Duvall, and Franco carried the film along with Hartnett, but I think it would've been beneficial to see more of him.

The first thing you notice is too much time between actors giving their lines to each other. I hate that. Duvall's wife can't act. English isn't her first language and may have a small part to do with that, but she rubbed me the wrong way right off the bat. Did not buy her as a ranger and her delivery was too slow as well. Duvall himself made me anxious because of his breathing. He seemed to be straining for each breath, yet lights up a cigarette, cause that's what cowboys do! Did he also allow himself some ad libbing here and there? Scenes were choppy. Fade to black then start up again without any smoothness whatsoever.

Duvall and Franco are the only ones on the screen that appear to know what they are doing there. It is a story of sin and the cost of that sin on the whole family, for a lifetime. A lifestyle choice that drags everyone into the gutter and acts as a cancer for the family and the community around them. Duvall is at the end of his life, trying to make things right with his children, to include his son who, like in the Bible story, left as a child to go out and sin, but comes back home to claim his part of the inheritance. The liberal story is pushed at you over and over, making you choke on the obviously twisted message. The Buford T Justice speed Texas Rangers are cringe worthy.

SKIP THIS"", ""As a genuine movie enthusiast, I can usually find something worthwhile in a movie... maybe it's an intriguing premise, even if it hasn't been at all well realised... maybe good performances elevate a hackneyed script... maybe there's great cinematography, if nothing else. But Wild Horses defies you to engage with it at every turn. It utterly fails to deliver as the psychological thriller it seems to aspire to be. The script offers no surprises or delights. The pace is so sluggish it often seems more like a rough cut than a finished film. And the female lead - Mrs Duval - gives the most amateurish performance seen in a Hollywood release in some decades. Mr Duval does his usual taciturn schtick to absolutely zero effect. And only James Franco seems to be investing his role with some genuine emotion and enthusiasm - perhaps in the misguided belief that it might be worth the effort. The up side to the boredom that the film generates is that you won't care when it fails to deliver any kind of satisfying ending. Best avoided."", ""I haven't seen any of the other films Robert Duvall has written or directed. There aren't many of them and there's possibly a very good reason for this. The man is a very fine actor, no one could deny that, but perhaps writing and directing are simply not for him if 'Wild Horses' is anything to go by. The script in particular is an absolute mess. The dialogue often feels like it's been written for a 5 year-old and by a 5 year-old. The story is told in incredibly clunky fashion and none of the intended 'heavy' scenes have any effect whatsoever on the audience.The directing is not much better. The actors all look completely lost in every scene. There's some very strange casting with the likes of Josh Hartnett and James Franco, but the strangest of all was Luciana Pedraza. She was so unbelievably bad in her performance I had to look up her IMDb profile just to see who exactly the hell she was - only to find she was in fact Duvall's sister-in-law, sigh! I can't imagine any other filmmaker being willing to cast her and yet I notice Duvall also cast her in his 2002 film 'Assasination Tango'. Perhaps he just makes a film every ten years or so with a role written specifically for her so she can pay some bills. Who knows, but it's really not a good look. An awful performance in an awful film. Nothing to see here."", ""This movie is unfortunately a turkey and or a lemon. Everything about it is just plain horrible: the acting, the story line, the script and above all: the directing. The director Robert Duvall must have totally lost any objectivity and clear thinking he could have shown in the making of this film. Well at least the Razzie Awards will most likely have a field day on which categories this stinker could be up for. How 'bout going for a grand slam? New Razzie world record perhaps? In the end this is all just too bad and a great big shame when they could have made a watchable and enjoyable film with money that was thrown away in the making of this horrible flick."", ""I adore Josh Hartnett and Robert Duvall. I am 'so sad' that the actors chosen to play the Rangers were so horrible, that even they must cry themselves to sleep at night for being so devoid of talent. Sadly, its not just those actors, but also the timing in the dialogue along with multiple directing errors; it was to the point that even changing scenes seemed to be an impossible feat. Josh did amazingly well considering the circumstances, but it is sad to see that an actor of his caliber was convinced to do this movie. Duvall did well in regards to his acting (in a way I would expect, as a fan of his), but by Duvall producing and directing this...I don't think we will see him again anytime soon. Unless, of course, he produces and pays for something better the next round (hopefully without actors with familial relations being used in the credits and deemed, 'actress'). Someone please!

Given a ticket to Rio De Jeneiro to handle a business closing by hard nosed business women Claudia Lirones, Jackie Bisset, Emily instead of practicing law ends up practicing something totally different. The movie is one of the weirdest films I\'ve ever seen with this strange off-the-wall cuckoo bird James Wheeler, Mickey Rourke,acting like he\'s playing chess with peoples lives. Wheeler has them act out his sexual fantasies as he sits and watches from afar or close up whenever the urge suits him. Poor Emily is put through the ringer by Wheeler\'s crazy cooked up sexual adventures, in which he\'s only a watcher not a participant, but in the end she gets what she set out to obtain; the deed to the waterfront property that Claudia wanted for her real-estate firm.Claudia herself had an ""affair"" with the creep-ed out Wheeler years earlier by impersonating a maid at the hotel that he was staying at and making his bed. This seemed to have been a big turn on for Wheeler, even though he knew who she was but pretended that he didn\'t, that later he gave her a very expensive dress for the good job that she did?There are a number of other strange sexual encounters between something like a half dozen wild parties in the movie that make even less sense. Very early in the film we, and Emily, see this couple sneak into a broken down and deserted building and strip off their clothes and then ""do it"" as a broken sewer pipe gushes water on their heads! was this real or a hallucination on Emily\'s part? There\'s also a hot tryst between Emily and Jerome, Bruch Greenwood, at his hotel room with Wheeler, who set up the whole thing, sitting on a bench outside observing it.Later Claudia blackmails Jerome who turns out to be the lawyer for a client who\'s suing her company to drop the case.

We also see Wheeler save Hanna, Assumpta Serna, and her wimpy husband Otto, Oleg Vidon, from a group of drunken and partying crazed sailors. The drunks were in the process of raping Hanna in broad daylight right in front of hundreds of party people who did nothing to help the poor women but watch and enjoy the action! And last but not least there was this beach boy ,who Claudia picked up, who after undressing in front of both Claudia and Emily and parading around in front of them butt naked is grabbed by the hair and kicked out of the penthouse by an enraged Wheeler who just seemed to have popped up out of nowhere! Why did this so disturb Wheeler? Was it that he had nothing to do with setting it up and thus feel that he was being upstaged by the two women? Wheeler who were told is a self-made millionaire who made it big in real estate and who had a speaking problem as a young boy in Philidelphia, he stuttered and that effected his not having any lasting or rewarding relationships with women, goes through almost the entire movie in what looks like a drugged induced state or just suffering from lack of sleep. It\'s not until the last ten minutes that he takes off his pants and, like everyone else in the movie, joins the party by letting it all hang out.Redicules ""erotic movie"" that was just an excuse for Mickey Rourke to put his girlfriend and real life lover at that time, 1989-90, Carre Otis in the movie as his leading lady and nothing else.', 'Well it wasn\'t ""that"" bad. The reason I watched it was from my memory of the initial release of the movie back in 1990 I remembered the strong hype about the movie in the media and critics were all over it. Then there was the news that Rourke and Otis allegedly sued the production crew for having hidden cameras on the studio and taped them having intercourse and were about to sell the footage to Hustler?? (I am not 100% sure anymore...it\'s been 14 years) I believe it was settled out of court subsequently like in 1992 or so??I couldn\'t watch it then as I was still a kid so I kinda watched it now and I must admit the story was lame as expected in these type of movies. Carre Otis cannot act. She\'s as hot as hell though even by today\'s standards. And if you are not into softcore sex scenes featuring a top model you are in the wrong place. A waste of money indeed if you actually paid to watch it in the theaters back in 1990. Nothing else to say. Over-hyped flick that\'s totally lame.2 out of 10', ""Wild Orchid is one of the most sexually explicit movies I recall seeing as a child. While the film is tame by today's standards when released in 1990 it was very explict. The storyline isn't to much to really speak of but Zalman King keeps Carrie Otis naked enough times to where the male viewer doesn't really care. The final sex scene makes you wonder if Rourke and Otis really went at it."", ""I felt that this was a good movie. It was very erotic to me. I saw it several years ago and just recently watched it again at a request for the movie by me. Mikey Rourke left a very sensuous impression on me in this movie whereas before I never looked at him in this way. I thought his role was very well performed. He was both mysterious and complicated. I would recommend this movie for couples to watch together. I felt that it was a very romantic and arousing movie. I believe that the review that I read was very harsh. I have found that many times when I watch a movie that doesn't get a lot of stars in its review, I seem to watch them and form my own different opinion. Wild Orchid is one of them. It fills the impulsive fantasies that some people have."", 'Some people see Carré Otis as lacking acting abilities. I don\'t. I have a hunch she\'s an HSP(*) and her biography seems to point out in that direction too. Therefore, she WAS acting and expressing emotions within her own range, and she did express them intensely as per her own emotional register. But since about only 15% of the population is HSP, no wonder that most people did not react to her performance. I see a lot of subtlety of emotions, DESPITE the requirements of acting her part. Ditto for Rourque whom I absolutely hated when I saw him in 9 1/2 weeks when it came out, way back then. In contrast, Jacqueline Bisset\'s performance, is more ""solid"", yet, I perceive it more as ""good acting"", i.e. she\'s clearly more distanced from her character, clearly less convincing in the eyes of an HSP than Rourque and especially Otis.Also, it seems that any movie that has a lot of sex in it must be deprecated, as per intellectual elitism spirit. I do not go along with that school of thought If you\'re not an HSP, you\'ll get bored by this movie because you simply cannot catch the subtle cues that HSP are so good at picking up.If you\'re an HSP, you\'ll it. I gave it a solid 7(*) HSP: Highly Sensitive Person. They are people that have a physiological enhanced sensitivity of their emotional system. The whole of their nervous systems, ranging from emotions to sensations behave as if someone has turned the microphone sensitivity setting to MAX while the rest of the population is comfortably set at 30%. HSP are, on average, more intelligent, get bored more easily and also gets to blow their emotional fuses more easily. While normal people have a dynamic range between 0 and ten with ten emotional levels in between the extremes, HSP operate in a narrow range between, say 4 and 7, and with ten times more gradations in between the lower and upper limit of their comfort zone than non-HSPs.

Sure, it's full of sex and naked people, but it also manages to be erotic and sensual at the same time. It's certainly not the commercialized absurdity that you'll find late night on certain premium channels. More than that, though, is that it's a decent psychological study of a man who's completely divorced himself from reality. Like so many celebs of our time, money and success has allowed him to distance himself from whatever parts of reality that make him uncomfortable. Emily's naive and honest approach manages to reach him. His speech near the end, before the final 'scene,' is really impressive, and Mikey really is a great actor. Sure, Ms. Otis leaves something to be desired, but she's working in a role where her lack of comfort helps the part. Emily is out of her element, just is the actress playing her is, and even if this makes her transparent, it also makes her believable. Jaqueline Bisset is wonderful as always. All in all, if you watch this film without fast forwarding from sex scene to sex scene, you'll see a fairly human story mixed with a sexual journey that I think Zora Neale Hurston would have appreciated."", 'The biggest thing about this movie is how beautiful it is. Yes, symbols are somehow too transparent, plot and music a bit cheesy,a bit too superficial, but it is so beautiful that you kinda forget those things. actors are beautiful , setting is beautiful, sex scenes are beautiful. Very sensual, but making-love-in-the-light-of-a-setting-sun-on-the-beach kinda way. however the funny thing is that you will enjoy the film nevertheless and not only because of sex, but somehow this film is appealing. thought you understand the flaws of this film, you still get aesthetic pleasure on some basic, unspoiled by good taste and good movies level. I like this film because it proves that good film can be made in any genre. You should remember that this is an erotic film. otherwise, if you expect an independent film about love, you should watch something else.', 'This movie made a lasting impression on me and it stands up well over time. The pulsing soundtrack, the great visuals of Rio, the brooding charisma of Mickey Rourke. Mickey Rourke, just past his prime...not quite the handsome 1980s version. He is starting to show his age a bit, however he still has the charisma of his youth. He is a man who has great wealth but is missing the emotional connection. The story is about an unusual relationship that develops in Rio De Janeiro where a young lawyer (Otis) meets the real estate tycoon Rourke who takes her on a journey. This film is also about the backdrop, Rio De Janeiro, one of the world\'s most compelling cities. It is utilized to much effect by the director to create an atmosphere where it feels anything is possible and the characters get lost in their desires.One irony of the movie is that it cast an American model in the lead role instead of a Brazilian model. Brazil is famous for it\'s beautiful models, but I suppose none were considered for this 1990 movie.Movies with sex and nudity are routinely mocked but super-violent graphic movies are praised. This is an ""erotic movie"" and it definitely accomplishes one aspect, having model Carre Otis appearing very beautiful, appealing and sensual. The pulsing soundtrack sets the tone and the great visuals make it a fun escape to Brazil.', 'It was the first film in which i saw Mickey Rourke...and I loved it in an instant!I love the way he acts and the way he looks....This film keeps me awaiting for whats happening the next minute. Its sexy and intense story felt like a spell. One thing is that i wished it was me with him in those scenes!I showed it to some friends of mine and they agreed with me that a good ambiance for this film is a rainy night at home with candles on and some red wine and maybe a guy to keep you company...because you will need some help if the film really gets to you...and Rourke looks so sexy on that motorcycle.Just put on a silk dress and watch this film....keeps you glued to the screen thats for sure what it did to me.', ""I bought this movie having seen it 15 years earlier.

If you are studying the art of seduction or just want to improve your ability to influence and control others, WATCH THIS MOVIE with that objective. Yes it may be acting, but it there is still much truth to how your mind works and the erotic journey on witch it can take you.

Even being infatuated by Chad, Holly\'s attitude is totally unexpected and inconsistent with her character since she is angry with her house trashed by Chad and Nicole\'s friends and ends in a threesome with them and doing the oral sex she had always refused to Reno.

However a lot of people, I think, don't like this movie for the lack of magic. It's obvious this wasn't a big studio production, no mentionable special effects, the filming has a bit of a cheap look and most of all the ending is more down to earth than Hollywood would dare give us. But for me, the end is just the thing that makes up for a lot of the flaws in this film.Like i said, the movie is not great, boring even at some times (I caught myself checking my watch once or twice), the characters just live their lives with all its ups and downs, they fight, make up and then jealousy makes them fight some more, but this is like real life and it's obvious they do love each other. The end of the story is equally real, something happens which calls for emotional decision making, and although the viewer may not agree (Because IT has all the facts of the story), sadly this is how things usually turn out.5 points out of 10 for the movie, and one extra just for the ending.""]",3,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance']"
Wild Strawberries,3.31,4.62,['Drama'],"After living a life marked by coldness, an aging professor is forced to confront the emptiness of his existence.",sadness,"[""Old professors on road trips, no matter how many fully dressed blonds you add, will probably never provide much wildness or strawberries, especially if they spend more time with them dreaming as they snooze during the trip then take in the landscape and people. Ingmar definitely failed despite apparently the entire country of Sweden voting to the contrary for their film hero. He hints that he may be attempting irony, but that really doesn't work outside of a few instances where the actors pull it off.One way the irony could have worked is if the film is understood more like Robot and Frank involving an old man nearing death with a failing brain. It might be seen as an allegory in why making plans based on a dream you have the night before is unlikely to add wildness or strawberries to your day.The film seems more like that of a young, naive director playing with university ideas and quite possibly trying to antagonize a professor he hated, or simply fool him into grading the film highly by not committing to anything and leaving it open for interpretation.At best, it's an interesting look into the Summer conventions and traditions of Sweden in the 1950s where pipe smoking is viewed as healthy and marrying cousins is normal. All this can be better achieved through some clips of the film, an actual documentary, and some photo essays. You'll also have the benefit of knowing it rather than wondering if you're lost in somebody's bad dreams."", 'As I look at all the 10 star reviews that others have given this film I wonder if I am being foolhardy in daring to say something to the contrary. I am and have been for many years a Bergman fan. I eagerly saw most of his films as they were released. I love nearly all of them - this one being an exception. Certainly the film is worth seeing - any Bergman film is. But this one is often cited as his best, and there I would strongly disagree. It is about an academic and although professor Borg has to face some of his demons, he comes out on top in then end. I understand why this film is so popular. Academics see themselves in professor Borg and academics have a lot of influence on what is considered art and what isn\'t. Borg ends up looking good at the end of the film, and academics, although they have their faults like anyone else, like to think that they are worthy of the respect that their position commands. In many, many cases they are - and this is not a diatribe against academics. I just think that Bergman let this character off too easily, particularly when you compare the way he treats his other characters in movies like ""The Hour of the Wolf"", ""The Silence"", ""Shame"" and so on. He plumbs the depths of the soul and takes no prisoners. ""Wild Strawberries"" starts out that way, when the professor flashes back to the key points in his life where he turned away from love, life and reality in favor of academic honor. But ultimately Bergman backs down. The professor, having seen the errors of a lifetime in a few short hours, is shown to be wiser and a better man now as he receives his honorary award. Bergman does not do this in his other films. For me this gives a certain falsity to ""Wild Strawberries"" that I don\'t see in ""Persona"" for example. Well, everyone will probably disagree with me, - this is such an acclaimed film - but sometimes it is valuable to hear a contrarian opinion even when you don\'t agree with it.', 'At the age of 78 a retired physician finds his life to have been empty and meaningless. At that age men are hardly reflective, from my experience. Usually they are convinced that everything they did was right, specially when life was determined by success. But that is not all: he even has a 98(!) year old mother who contributes to his reflection. Pacing is always slow and the dialogue had a sedative effect on me. After seeing some of the dream sequences I almost started dreaming myself. So now you are warned. 6  / 10', ""I just started a complete Bergman cycle as I hadn't seen any of his movies and was quite ashamed of it! This is my third one, I saw Sawdust & Tinsel and the Seventh Seal yesterday. Seventh Seal was very profound and original, although I was disappointed by the quality of the Black&White photography. I still graded it much higher than wild strawberries.Here, the acting is excellent, the directing is unsurprisingly excellent too. The storyline is very profound so are the dialogs and before all there's grace. Although the soundtrack is disappointing and the photography still doesn't deserve any awe.I was interested by this story of an old man looking back at his life; some people compared it to About Schmidt, on a similar subject it's true, but not as profound. An equally profound movie on this subject that I think is superior (despite some slow and long passages) is ETERNITY AND A DAY by Theo Angelopoulos. Bruno Ganz moves me much more than Sjostrom and the symbols all along make the dreams more subtle. The photography is better and the discreet soundtrack accompanies magnificently the pictures.In conclusion, wild Strawberries is a very good movie but we may have done better since and it seems to me that it's a little bit overrated."", ""Bergman has been seen by many as being a depressing film makes, who speaks above the heads of most people.  Thank God someone does! In this piece of genius, we are asked to consider who God is; what makes a life worthwhile; and whether human nature alters through the generations, or is it just the costumes that change?  As usual, the answers are to be provided by the audience.  We must chose for ourselves what we think is 'right' or 'just'. Bergman uses the usual pattern for him - a man is on a journey (life) and meets people who are going along the same road (friends and family), and they all head toward the end of their trip (death).  They stop in for obligatory visits with relatives and for food (as we all do), receive an honourary degree (fame & success?), and then send the children off to a party held in our honour that we do not attend (funeral).  What happens along the way is important, but we always end up in the same place - the end. Wonderful editing techniques, good story, good images, fantastic acting, and more ideas and questions to ponder than one film can hold - or so you thought.  It's only after the film ends that these ponderings come to you. During the film, you simply watch a man travel from his home to another city, but this is far from what the film is about. See this film once, think about the questions it poses, then rewind and see it again.  You will be rewarded for doing so."", ""(Slight Spoilers) A man's life journey is all seen through a number of dreams and hallucinations on his trip, some 400 miles, to the town of Lund where he's to receive a lifetime achievement award for his 50 or so years of service to his fellow man as a doctor and a professor of medicine at his alma mater the Cathedral of Lund.Disturbed by a dream he had the night before Isak Borg decides to take a ride by car, not plane, to Lund for a ceremony thats to be in his honor for his work as a man of medicine. Isak's maid for some 40 years Agda is very upset with her boss' and good friends decision and decides to stay at home, she'll eventually show up at the ceremony, feeling that the old man has somehow lost control of his senses. It turns out that the long car trip together with his daughter-in-law Marianne was one of the best decision that he made in his long life, Isak is 78 years old. The trip that Isak takes will bring back past memories that he so desperately tried to hide from himself. That past will in effect make him not only a better person but bring back the feeling of humanity that he lost not only for himself over these long and empty years. Not only for Isak but for those close to him whom he more or less also lost contact with. Isak,in both his dreams and memories, is seen as a man who is unable to show any real feelings for those around and close to him in the fear of either being rejected as well as showing himself to be hurt by their negative responses.This defect in Isak personality has cost him the love of his life Sara when he was a young man who rejected him for his handsome and openly aggressive older brother Sigfried. We also see that Isak's marriage to his wife, who had long since passed away, Karin was anything but happy with her disgusted with his inability to show her any real feelings and emotions as a husband. Were also shown, in one of Isak's dreams, that she had an affair with another man Ake Fridell, who was anything but passive with her like her husband Isak was, some 40 years ago behind his back. That may have possibly resulted in the birth of his only child his son, who's also a doctor, Evald Marriane's husband.Seeing his 96 year-old mother on his way to Lund we see in her the same human defect that he has in that all of her ten children, who with the exception of Isak are now deceased, never bothered to visit her in her old age. The only time that they had anything to do with her was when they wanted money from the old lady. This coldness and inability to have any attachment to her children is shown not only in both Isak and his mother but in his son Evald who's so disgusted with life and what it had to offer him, like a beautiful and caring wife like Marianne. Evald threatened to walk out on Marianne when after he found out of her being pregnant, I guess by him, she refused his demand of her getting an abortion.Isak is helped on his long trip to Lund not only by Marianne but a number of people they meet and in some cases give a ride along the way. This included a young girl and two of her friend going on a trip to Italy ironically named Sara, a virtual twin of the Sara that he loved and lost as a young man. Later Sara together with Anders and Victor who later as a singing group serenade a surprised and grateful, to the point of tears, Isak after he received his award. Meeting among others along the way to far flung Lund a bickering couple Mr. & Mrs. Alman, who almost had Isak and his passengers killed in a head-on car crash. Isak also met a gas station attendant, Henrik, who was so impressed and grateful by what he did for him and his wife in the past , delivered their first child, that he refused to get paid for filling up Isak's gas-tank.By the time Isak got to Lund and received his lifetime achievement award to the attendance and cheering of the entire town he not only realized all the good that he did as a man of medicine all these years but also all the hurt that he gave to others, if unintentional. With the little time that he has left, Isak was to pass away three years later at the age of 81, Isak is determined to make up for it.Sweet touching yet simple little film about one man's journey back in time who sees how he missed out on the many wonderful things that life had to offer him by being blind to them. Now given a second chance Isak would try as best as he can to both re-live and at the same time correct his past mistakes."", ""Although I'm not the biggest Ingmar Bergman fan, I have really enjoyed some of his movies--especially the one that are not so pessimistic. Although the underlying theme of this movie is aging and impending death, the movie is NOT all pessimism. If it had been, it would have lost my interest early on. Instead, I really enjoyed the film--particularly the fine acting by Victor Sjöström as Professor Borg.The professor is well-respected for his work as a doctor. However, despite his success in his career, he is a failure in his personal relationships. His emotional baggage over the years has prevented him from allowing himself to be close to those he truly loves. This theme mirrors one of the subplots of Through a Glass Darkly, where a father is being destroyed inside by his daughter's mental illness but he CANNOT allow himself to show his anguish--choosing instead to hide in his room with his tears. It is interesting that the same man playing Borg's son (Gunnar Björnstrand) plays the father only a few years later in Through a Glass Darkly.Fortunately, unlike Through a Glass Darkly, there IS evidence that the professor is willing to change his persona, as he begins to open up more through the course of the movie. This appears to be assisted through extensive soul searching and dreams the professor has concerning his past and his own mortality--along with experiences he has during a long drive down the coast of Sweden. Because of this, even his extremely strained relationship with his son appears to hold some hope of improvement by the film's end. This hope for change lifts this movie above some Bergman films that only wallow in hopelessness.FYI--The Criterion version of this DVD is nice due to its running commentary as well as the accompanying documentary. Get this version if you have the chance.Also FYI--After watching many Bergman films and reading about his life, I detect quite a bit of autobiography in this film and his own stuggles with intimacy."", ""...and having said that I can say this might be one of Bergman's critically over-rated pictures. Of course there is much to look for, admire, and saturate with his tale of an old professor/doctor on his way to get a degree who looks back on his life, but the road trip scenes, while somewhat fascinating, can't hold a candle to the work that is displayed in the first dream. We see clocks with no hands (no time left for the old timer), a man with a very tightened face, and a coffin that falls right in front of the old man with himself inside of it, reflecting him. That this is one of Bergman's most evocative and powerful scenes goes to show why the film is so praised, and with the other dreams we see much insight into his fears and doubts on his life and what it's meant. But a number of the scenes go nowhere or ponder on events that slow the film down. Wild Strawberries is a film that can be judged as a display of perfect sorrow or longish observation, you decide. Plenty of beautiful outdoor scenery shots though; Max Von Sydow has a cameo as a gas station attendant. Grade: A.""]",8,['Drama']

The budget was extravagant and the box-office returns just barely covered the big fat price tag. And as measly as a movie as this was for it\'s day on it\'s own merits, it\'s dwarfed even further by the immortal ""Lord Of The Rings"" saga.""Willow"" is the film the impish Warwick Davis is renown for his participation in most, not counting the never-ending ""Leprechaun"" schlock movies.This was his first lead role and he brings a likable and earnest charisma to the role instead of just trying to be little and cute like so many child performers and other midget actors. Thankfully, he proves himself as to be more than just a cheap gimmick like so many other ""bit-players."" He allows himself to really give a true performance and the film itself doesn\'t go for the cheapest of shots with any of the height of it\'s little people.As a filmmaker, George Lucas is and has always been a homage-payer. He\'s one of those filmmakers who always tries to re-make those old films he loved during his own adolescence. With space operas: ""Star Wars,"" With Matinée Adventure flicks: ""Indiana Jones,"" With futuristic sci-fi adventures, ""THX 1138."" And now with ""Willow,"" he attempts to do the same for the sword-and-sorcery genre.The whole universe is derived from the whole medieval sword-and-sorcery genre. And it\'s a full bar and buffet smörgåsbord here: We\'ve got ""Lord Of The Rings,"" ""The Story of Moses,"" ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" ""Sleeping Beauty"" and ""Gulliver\'s Travels"" just to name a few.Val Kilmer is pound-for-pound one of the great heavyweight champion actors from here The 20th century and the 21st saw few better thespians. He truly delivered an Oscar for his re-birth as Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone\'s ""The Doors."" Here, anyone could have done the same job he does. It\'s his most unremarkable performance to date. They didn\'t need the great Kilmer for this one.Any stock actor with a SAG card or with one year of high school drama class experience could have done as good a job.Jean Marsh does a good job as Queen Bavmorda, but just about any random British actress on the planet could have done the same and gotten the same results.Sadly, this one just stands toe-to-toe with the He-Man ""Master Of The Universe"" movie from 1987.Even though Ron Howard Opie Cunningham was at the helm for this one, just about any hack with access to a tripod (that tilts low) could have done the same and gotten the same results.The real problem with ""Willow"" is that it\'s totally unremarkable. It\'s about a likable little guy with a big heart for his family. He has a magical gift and uses it to make a name for himself. He meets a great warrior with a shady record who may find love along the way.They do battle with a wicked queen who happens to be a powerful witch with a great army, a two-headed dragon, a menacing lieutenant General who wears a mask scarier than his own face, yada yada yada yada. Do you even care? There are two little like the 3-inch tall people in ""Gulliver\'s Travels"" called Brownies named Rool and Franjean with helium voices and ethnic caricatured French accents that would have been considered embarrassing in the \'30\'s. They irritate and confuse, but never amuse. Unlike R2D2 and C3PO or Marcus Brody, they never provoke as much as a smile.Lucas planned for this to be something of a series saga of films. But since this one barely made any return whatsoever, Lucas wound up scrapping the film ""trilogy"" and continuing the story in books. Hey, anyone out there ever actually so much as read a copy of the continuing ""Willow"" story? With ""Star Wars,"" ""THX 1138"" and ""American Graffiti,"" Lucas swung for the fence like a dominant male gorilla. He pulled out all stops and then some. This one is on-par with your average episode of a Saturday Morning TV series, even for the day.You can see anything just as good and inspired/thrilling/etc. every Saturday morning on just about any network.Unlike ""Star Wars,"" ""Indiana Jones"" or ""Cocoon,"" this is not a product of theirs that defines the genre it\'s from.And what is it with baby Elora Danan? She\'s so much of the damn plot and yet, all she does really is smile and cry on cue. There are babies in diaper commercials who have characters with more depth.I like the two-headed dragon. It doesn\'t look like the traditional fire-breathing dragon. It hardly even looks like a serpent. This one is kind of inspired. As a change of pace, it has more of an ugly look to it with long and furry serpent necks, almost like an ostrich. It\'s really weird.Although, it\'s one of the few inspired touches in this routine medieval epic.It\'s a Lucasfilm Ltd. production, so the special effects are (as it goes without saying) in the Oscar nomination territory. Enthralling for the day, some even by today\'s standards still shine. Lucas has made a bigger name for himself as a innovator of special effects than as a filmmaker.While it was a defining role for actor Warwick Davis and it employs more midgets and dwarfs than any other production (and respectively), for anyone else, ""Willow"" is never anything special, nor does it attempt to be.Even for it\'s day ""Willow"" was unremarkable. Seriously, how many tales of swords, sorcery, kings, queens, dwarfs, dragons, trolls had we seen in movies, TV, books, fairy tales and what-have-you before this came along? Yet another case of, ""Too little, too late."" Nearly 20 years later, that old axiom proves even more true.--For The Little People, Dane Youssef', 'This is another of those old-fashioned medieval fantasy adventures filled with sorcerers, dwarfs, other tiny people and some strange-looking animals. the film has a lot of action, almost too much, especially for little kids. It get a little intense for small kids. Actually, I think it\'s more of an adult movie, and only so-so at best until the last 30-40 minutes when some very good special-effects made it much more interesting.The movie centers around a cute baby, who is good at making faces for after awhile it becomes routine and obvious that the facial shots were taken elsewhere, not in the scene. Overall, ""fair at best"" describes this movie that wavers between adults and kids and wound up a bit unsatisfying. Thankfully, for fantasy fans there have been far better films since then to whet our appetites.', ""I never felt caught up in the simplistic storyline of this film, nor did I find myself caring about any of the characters.  The special effects, while of course laughable today, don't even seem to measure up to 1987 standards -- they are more reminiscent of 1960s Japanese monster movies than what was available to George Lucas in the late 1980s.Val Kilmer was one bright spot in the film, with a wonderfully mocking, roguish performance."", 'For its day, Willow was one of the better fantasy movies. The effects look a little dated now (especially the two-headed beastie) but it has enough humour and action to keep most satisfied. It\'s no LOTR, but then it was made 14 years ago.Warwick Davis plays Willow, a Nelwynn, a race of hobbit-sized folk who don\'t have anything to do with ""The Big People"" as they call humans. Basically, it\'s the Shire transplanted into this movie, but without the budget. Billy Barty is the village\'s wizard and basically plays the character Gweldor again (from Masters of the Universe) but without the silly make-up and stupid musical key.Val Kilmer is Madmartigan, a human warrior who befriends Willow and helps him on his journey with varying degrees of ulterior motive.The acting is all reasonably good. Warwick Davis was only 18 when this film was released so his performance is very good considering his age and lack of experience (prior to this he\'d played a goblin in Labyrinth and an ewok in Return of the Jedi). It\'s also interesting to see Pat Roach here. Pat was a former wrestler and has carved out a little niche for himself playing villains and tough guys. Here he plays General Kael, the right-hand henchman of Queen Bavmorda, played with gusto by Jean Marsh. That woman is truly frightening.It\'s all good fun and the two funniest characters in the movie are Franjean and Rool, two Brownies, who ""help"" Willow regardless of the latters wishes. They have the funniest double act and reminded me more than a little of Merry and Pippin in LOTR.All in all well worth a watch if you want some pure, and somewhat silly, entertainment.', ""Considering how few really good fantasy movies there are out there, this one has to rate pretty high.  It is a rather good movie that is fast paced and fun, but it does contain flaws.  The main one is Warwick Davis.  In some scenes he is good, but in other scenes his character comes off as a bit too whiny.  The story is kind of a take off of The Lord of the Rings books.  A man, small in statute, has to keep a baby safe from an evil queen who wants to sacrifice it cause it may grow up to kill her.  While protecting the child Willow (Davis' character) runs into a swordsman played by Val Kilmer. He does a great job playing this character and is my favorite character in the movie.  Some of the effects are good, and some quite lame (the two little guys accompanying Willow), but considering this was 1987 you can overlook this.  The battle scenes are ok (the one at the abandoned castle is the best), but they are just not on the scale of other movies of this type. This movie is worth a look though."", ""I remember seeing this film in theaters back in '88 and long to see it again on the big screen. There is a motherload of crappy fantasy flicks out there and this one is better than most. I was kinda young when I saw it and didn't find it too violent but some parents may think it gruesome at times. I myself feel that gave it an edge. Along with swordplay there are nasty trolls,a 2-headed beast,mean-spirited characters and some intense scenes at the end. Of course there are lots of special effects. This was a technically well made film with awesome cinematography and interesting locations. Every now and again Fox airs the movie but it's 2 1/2 hr running  can be really cut. Ya gotta see it!"", 'To sum things up, this was really a George Lucus film-with the then relatively inexperienced Ron Howard hired to direct-under the watchful eye of Lucus. Lucus wrote the screenplay, raiding his bookshelf for Tolkein (especially ""The Hobbit"") and Lewis (""Narnia""). Then he simply transferred the hero/heroine romance from his ""Star Wars"" screenplay. Not necessarily a bad thing, it was a simple way for him to build a feature length screenplay targeting younger viewers but sophisticated enough to entertain the entire family. ""Willow"" has some scary stuff but should not be a problem for the average grade school viewer. My rating is based on comparisons to other films with a similar target audience. I must confess up-front to a positive bias. My favorite part of ""Star Wars"" is the caustic romance between Han Solo and Princess Leia; and in ""Willow"" Lucus has refined his technique and actually improved something that was already close to perfection. Sorsha (Joanne Whalley) and Madmartigan (Val Kilmer) substitute nicely for Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford, with the added dimension of having them begin the story on opposite sides. The romantic elements are efficiently and subtly inserted into the film. Even though these characters are part of the main storyline, the romance is separate enough to serve as the film\'s main parallel story. The only downside is that this side story soon becomes more interesting than the main one, so much so that its climatic kiss (occurring about 20 minutes before the ending) unintentionally turns into the film\'s climax (at least energy wise). The actual resolution of the main story then plays out rather anti-climatically. ""Willow"" is a delivery quest story, much like ""The Hobbit"" where a reluctant Nelwyn (small person) is required to set out on a perilous journey to return a lost baby (even smaller) to a Daikini (tall person). Along the way he is assisted by a couple of Brownies (yet smaller guys who speak with outrageous French accents). The size differentials are the main theme of the film and are especially intriguing to young viewers who easily identify with having to deal with people who tower above them. Howard encourages this identification process by shooting most of the action at child level. If you watch the film with young children you will be amazed at its ability to draw them into the story, this happens because the camera angles intentionally match a child\'s point-of-view of the world. The viewing child\'s surrogate is the title character (Warwick Davis-who does a commentary on the DVD), a unlikely hero who inspires audience sympathy as he bravely faces the dangers of his journey while gamely putting up with an ever-changing group of irritating companions. There are frequent cutaways to Elora Danan (the baby), mostly for reaction shots. As in ""Raising Arizona"", the producers took enough stock clips to match her expressions to almost any situation. Willow learns early on from Cherlindrea (a dazzling fairy) that Elora Danan is a princess who (it has been foretold) will one day vanquish the evil Queen Baymorda (a fun role for Jean Marsh). Things get a bit Biblical/Narnia here as the Queen is seeking to eliminate the Princess before she becomes a threat. The DVD features: ""Willow:The Making of an Adventure"" (made during production in 1988) and ""Willow: Morf to Morphing"" (made in 2001 for the DVD release), really put the film in historical context relative to its place in the evolution of special effects. It was really the transitional point where photochemical (film) effects were subordinated to digital effects. This gave ""Willow"" a significant place in film history and these two featurettes taken together nicely illustrate the continuing challenge to those involved with special effects; any new development is soon overused and no longer an audience draw. Meaning that effects people have to stay on the cutting edge to simply justify their existence. Then again, what do I know? I\'m only a child.', ""'Willow',is a good movie that anyone can enjoy.The movie has good music and good action.I have to say the two head monster was the only bad thing about the movie,Lucas could have done better.The actors give a good performance.I would give this movie 8/10.So if you want a movie that gives good action,good music and a story about times long ago,'willow' is the one."", ""When Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon in 1969, the whole world paused; now such things are second nature to everyone, veritably taken for granted as more and more science fiction becomes reality every day.  In 1977, when George Lucas made `Star Wars,' it turned the cinematic universe on it's ear with it's scope and vision, offering things neither seen nor experienced by anyone before; now his accomplishments are virtually taken for granted, his vision dismissed by many with a shrug.  But in this original story by Lucas, that vision is captured once again and proffered to the world via the magic of the movies, in `Willow,' directed by Ron Howard.\tA long time ago, in a galaxy perhaps far, far away, a baby comes into the care of the elvish Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis) and his wife, Kaiya (Julie Peters).  The infant bears the birthmark of the one prophesied to come who will put an end to the tyrannical rule of the evil Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh).  But the Queen, too, knows of the prophecy and is seeking the baby bearing the telltale mark.  For the sake of his village, as well as the safety of the child, it falls to Willow to transport the baby to a safe haven beyond the boundaries of his land and the reach of Queen Bavmorda.  So Willow sets out upon his journey, and along the way finds an ally-- maybe-- in the person of the self-proclaimed `World's greatest swordsman,' Madmartigan (Val Kilmer), and together (sort of) they embark upon an adventure that will ultimately lead them to a final confrontation with the evil Queen herself.\tWith some help from George Lucas, Ron Howard delivers this highly imaginative tale-- which bears that unmistakable Lucas touch-- with a touch of magic of his own.  A showcase of special F/X-- it pioneered the `morphing' technique so vital to the success of films like `The Abyss' (filmed one year after this one) and `Terminator 2:  Judgment Day' (1991)-- it is nevertheless decidedly not a `special F/X' movie.  The F/X, though a big part of the film, to be sure, do not supersede the story.  And because of that, it makes that necessary emotional connection with the characters possible, and takes the whole film to a higher level.  A big part of what has made Lucas and Howard so successful, in fact, is that innate ability of being able to tap into the humanity of any given story (With Lucas, for example, his `American Graffiti' and even `THX-1138,' and Howard's `Parenthood,' `Night Shift' and `Apollo 13') and knowing how to convey it to their audience.  It's the difference between being a true filmmaker, and just someone to whom an opportunity is handed who simply hasn't the insight or sense of human nature to know what to do with it (Like Adam Shankman with `The Wedding Planner,' Jeff Franklin's `Love Stinks,' Nick Gomez with `Drowning Mona' or Peter Ho-sun Chan's `The Love Letter.'  All movies that suffered greatly because of their director's inability to do what Lucas and Howard do so proficiently and seemingly with facility).\tIn the title role, Warwick Davis does a good job of bringing Willow to life, as does Val Kilmer in the flashier role of Madmartigan.  Joanne Whalley does a decent turn as Sorsha, daughter of the evil Queen, but is overshadowed by the deliciously sinister rendering of Bavmorda by Jean Marsh, whose wickedness is shamefully delightful.\tIn a supporting role, however-- and with extremely limited screen time-- it is Julie Peters who really captures the attention with a sincere and affecting performance as Kaiya.  She has such a pure and natural manner that it's hard to believe this is an actor playing a part; the realism she achieves, in fact, can be compared to that of Harriet Andersson in any one of a number of Ingmar Bergman's films.  Her ability is a true gift that endows her with a quality and a presence that would make her an asset to any film, as she certainly is here.  And it's a shame she has apparently never been afforded the opportunity of plying her craft more-- `Willow' is her only feature film.  It's a singular success, however, and one of which she can be proud.  Her portrayal of Kaiya goes far in demonstrating the positive effect a supporting role can have on a film, especially when it's this well acted.\tThe supporting cast includes Patricia Hayes (Fin Raziel), Billy Barty (High Aldwin), Pat Roach (General Kael), Gavan O'Herlihy (Airk), David Steinberg (Meegosh), Mark Northover (Burglekutt), Kevin Pollak (Rool), Rick Overton (Franjean) and Maria Holvoe (Cherlindrea).  With an intelligent screenplay by Bob Dolman and original music by James Horner, `Willow' is an entertaining, enlightening film, rich in characterization and metaphor, with a subtle message and a moral that unobtrusively makes a statement about diversity and the value of an individual's contributions to the society of which he is a part; as well as the fact that one person can, indeed, make a difference.  Visually stunning, too, it's a transporting experience truly filled with magic, and a journey definitely worth taking.  I rate this one 9/10.""]",10,"['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Action']"
Wilson,2.77,3.27,"['Romance', 'Drama', 'History', 'Music']",A chronicle of the political career of US President Woodrow Wilson.,anticipation,"['Wilson is the ""feel good comedy of the year"" filled with interesting characters, quirky places and anchored by a strong, unique and Oscar-worthy performance by Woody Harrelson.April FoolsWhat a mess this movie is. \xa0It tries so hard to be a ""quirky comedy"" that it focuses all of it\'s attention on the quirk and very little on what makes quirky comedies work - the characters.Let\'s start with the biggest problem with this film - the central performance of Woody Harrelson as the titular Wilson. \xa0When we first see him, he is a ""get off my lawn"" grumpy old man. \xa0In the next scene, he is an inappropriate ""close talker"", in the next it seems he has no filter. \xa0In the next, he has a childlike wonder. \xa0All of these adds up to various ""quirks"" of the character, but none of them equal a character. \xa0What they do is confuse the audience as to what kind of character they are watching. \xa0So when Wilson finally has the heart-breaking moment that will change him - we are left to wonder if he is changed for the better, or the worse or is he even changed. \xa0And I concluded with the worst comment of all...I don\'t care.This film is based on a graphic novel and a screenplay by Daniel Clowes (Ghost World) and the Direction is by Craig Johnson (The Skeleton Twins) - both of whom has done good work in the past, but this just isn\'t. \xa0The direction is all over the board bouncing from comedy to drama, but mostly landing in some mediocre middle area between the two, which drains the emotion from the proceedings. \xa0Writer Clowes must know this character in his head, and I\'m sure it makes sense to him, but it sure didn\'t to me and this effort fails miserably.There are some redeeming qualities, as the film is filled with strong performers in the supporting roles filled with the likes of Margot Martindale, Judy Greer, Mary Lynn Rajskub and Cheryl Hines, but they are on the screen all too briefly and I would have liked to have seen a film digging deeper into these characters (without Wilson). \xa0Only Laura Dern, as Wilson\'s ex-wife, acquits herself well. \xa0Her damaged, healing soul\xa0was the lone bright spot that made me sit up whenever she was on the screen.This movie was filmed in the Twin Cities, so at least I had some fun picking out the locations on the screen.\xa0 Unfortunately, the filmmakers, again, went for ""quirky"" so I become very cynical about what location was coming up next. \xa0I have the feeling the location scout was told to find ""the odd, the weird and the quirky"" in the Twin Cities. \xa0And, with that, they were successful.Letter Grade: \xa0C-3 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)', ""Imagine how hard it must be to make a film about an obnoxious self-obsessed neurotic nobody. Maybe add several equally unlikeable characters then tell a story that starts and ends nowhere special with little of interest happening in between. This is the film Wilson (2017) and calling it a black comedy does nothing to lighten its dead weight. But it begs the question: why was this film made?There are two ways to read Wilson and both depend on your threshold for finding people unbearable. Wilson (Woody Harrelson) is either a radically honest out-of-the-ballpark quirky communicator who has no filters, boundaries or respect for the normal conventions of social interaction; or he is a toxic human being who you would avoid at all costs. Or perhaps he is both. When his father dies, he is confronted by the ultimate existential crisis: divorced, alone and unloved, he ponders what does his life mean? He tracks down his ex-wife who he has not seen for 17 years in the hope that some spark of affection might be rekindled. She has not had an easy life, having been a 'crack whore' and a streetwalker. As if mentioning a mutual acquaintance they once knew, she tells him she had baby girl 17 years ago who was put up for adoption. Wilson's emotional world implodes and the rest of the film tracks his pathetic efforts to reclaim his alienated daughter and become the father he always hoped to be. In the final scenes, the story jumps to his release from jail after serving time for kidnapping his daughter, and we are meant to celebrate the reluctant reunion in a kind of 'blood is thicker than water' moral finale to this pointless story.Conventional film review criteria like characterisation, filming and narrative coherence seem irrelevant for a story based on repulsive people doing stupid things. The dialogue is trite and unfunny, and attempts at absurdist humour fall flat, or worse, are alienating. For example, when Wilson enters a near-empty train carriage to pester a stranger with intrusive and out-of-place questions, we squirm with discomfort as we do when he ridiculously gawks at a stranger urinating. His insistence on paternal rights irrespective of his daughter's needs verges on irrational psychological abuse. There are many reasons to dislike this film, including the laboured sexual references disguised as humour and the implied linking of his daughter's body-image issues to her adoption. If there is hidden meaning in Wilson, this reviewer has failed to find it."", ""The movie didn't make much sense to me. Maybe after a second watch i would understand it better. That makes the movie unwatchable. My friend gave it a 5.8 had some laughs, maybe he is older and understands the human relationships more.2/10 from me and 5.8 from him."", ""Have you ever met a person that was always so negative; a complete narcissist; a complete nut case who goes about doing all the wrong things, and makes the worst life choices ever? Well, if you do know a person like that and want to compare them to someone else as neurotic, Wilson is the movie for you. Woody Harrelson plays the titular title character with as much pizazz and life as possible while being an inherently bleak as can be.Harrelson's Wilson can best be described as the ultimate misanthrope. Nevermind Ebenezer Scrooge, Wilson is the real deal when it comes to pessimism. Taking the world with less than a grain of salt, Wilson tackles the world with the most obvious sense of negativity, blaming people and society for all that's gone wrong in his life, including his; love life, family life and most of all, all of his own quirks and habits. Don't believe us? Just pay close attention to one very short and emotionally draining scene where Wilson visits his father on his deathbed. Like so many cases after this scene, Wilson seeks for retribution and peace in all the wrong places and times.Clearly the oddball in his almost picturesque Minnesota community, Wilson's world shakes and shatters upon the discovery that an old flame and frequent drug user Pippi (Laura Dern) decided to keep a child they had together, who later independently decided to put the girl up for adaption. Upon the discovery of Pippi, and some sort of hope that the once love would rekindle, Wilson takes it upon himself to find his daughter Claire (Isabella Amara) and the beautiful urban family who has taken the responsibility to raise Claire as their own. As expected, in the most distasteful and awkward way possible, Wilson, along with Pippi, make it a hobby to include themselves in Claire's life almost forcefully.Having an almost crude and grimy way of connecting with humanity as a whole, Wilson makes good-intentioned decision to involve himself in Claire's life, until things begins to spiral out of control, in familiar Wilson-fashion, leading Wilson to state penitentiary.Luckily for us, Harrelson, one of the most versatile and interesting actors working today, allows Wilson to be a very engaging and interesting character film, focusing on the ideas of longing and loneliness. While we were fortunate enough to have the film written by Daniel Clowes, the original author of which the graphic novel the film is based off of, and Craig Johnson, director of the totally off-beat but satisfying tragic comedy The Skeleton Twins, Clowes and Johnson are able to keep the spunkiness of the almost two hour film somewhat light, keeping its flowing characters in serious need of redemption mostly entertaining and engaging.Do not get it twisted, Wilson is a very dark and comedic film, just not dark in the sense that depression and pill popping may ensue after. While Clowes has a knack of making really funny situations and characters depressing and almost unchangeable, Wilson does progress towards a satisfying yet, in its own way, Hollywood ending. While I did long for a more in-depth look or analysis of Wilson's relationship with his father, it never comes.While Wilson showcases the many levels and various temperaments of a very flawed and almost unlikable character, by the end of the film, one cannot help to kinda/sorta fall in love with Wilson. There is an illustrious comedic poignancy of the man who barely reaps the benefits of all of life's wonderful yet disillusioning obstacles. Decorated with slight glimpses of retribution for our beloved inane character, the world in which Wilson longs for is one that is slightly unattainable, yet charmingly whimsical.Harrelson is an actor that can pretty well play anything and anyone. Slap on a pair of thick framed glasses, a shaggy silver-laced beard and Harrelson nails all of the nuances of a impulsive man for whom bell tolls for on a daily basis, blowing up everything and everyone in his crazy and directionless path.Luckily for Clowes and Johnson (the original author of the source material and director) were able to assembler a quite impressive cast for a Sundance and indie darling. With the likes of Harrelson, Dern, Cheryl Hines and Judy Greer, giving a well needed spunk and kick in the ass to a somewhat joyless narrative, despite some uncomfortably appealing scenes of Wilson within a school playground and pet shop parking lot.Overall, Wilson may probably not be your most beloved feature of 2017, nor will it be your most memorable. Luckily for us, art is always a reflection of the images we see on screen, and if there is anything Wilson does well, its reminding us that there is light at the end of the tunnel; and no matter how bad things may end up looking or really are, hope, happiness and redemption is always in store, just don't squander on the opportunities once they becomes apparent."", 'If anything Wilson, the story of a lonely middle-aged man reuniting with his estranged wife to meet his daughter for the first time, accomplishes something no movie has ever done. It manages to take Woody Harrelson, a jewel of the large and small screen, and make him wholly unlikable. This is no easy feat, especially considering that his character\'s only real crime is being a watered-down Marc Maron caricature. The man cavalierly ponders the big questions and graciously oozes cookie cutter wisdom to anyone within earshot. He thinks he\'s being avuncular but really he\'s just being really, really annoying.This problem extends to the film itself. It thinks it\'s intelligent and it thinks it\'s giving us earth-shattering insights into the human condition. It lazily employs an unstructured narrative of Wilson-centric coming-of-age clichés and pads its screen time with tonally discordant moments that fly at you fast then disappear without consequence. The results is a frustrating soup of characters, conflicts, themes and rickety-old shtick that goes no where and accomplishes nothing.Of course this could be the point; the movie purports to be about life. Ergo, if life is messy then so is this movie. Yet the films total lack of focus seeps to its DNA with scenes and plot points that announce themselves as loudly as possible and climax too quickly. In one scene, Wilson (Harrelson) learns that his only two friends (Rajskub and Gelman) are moving to St. Louis. He doesn\'t take it well, prodding them until they erupt in what felt like years of pent-up frustration. It\'s a good little scene but we\'re never given any time to savor it before the movie switches gears like the slides of a carousel projector.And at the front giving the presentation is Wilson who, for better or worse is the smartest person in the film. No one dares call him out on his bulls**t, especially not Pippi (Dern) his wife who\'s just barely keeping things together after a series of bad life choices. At times, she reacts like a prisoner to Wilson\'s somewhat terrifying mid-life crisis. But by the end of the story she succumbs to the idea that her surly former lover may just be wiser beyond his years.Yeah no, the man\'s a petulant, mean-spirited, less clever, less literate Bukowski character made near-flesh by someone who saw a Woody Allen movie once and thought, ""gee, how can I take out all this pesky pithiness."" I guess in that regard Wilson can be accredited for one more accomplishment. It managed to take the daily struggles of a middle-aged white man and make them appear trivial and redundant.', 'In the beginning of ""Wilson,"" Woody Harrelson\'s loser character laments the rise of people on social media and zoning out listening to earbuds, mourning the death of human interaction. Then, he shows us the reason why people listen to headphones in public: so they don\'t get in inane conversations with people like him. As with Ghost World (and Art School Confidential, less successfully) Daniel Clowes adapts his basically plot less comic into a feature length film, shoehorning a plot into what was just a character piece. Really, this is just the misadventures of a socially awkward, overly truthful, but extroverted person. But the pinned on plot concerns Wilson reuniting with his troubled ex, finding their bullied daughter who\'d been adopted away, getting in trouble for contacting said daughter, and forming a new relationship with a yoga instructor. When his reunion with his daughter goes south, this previously lighthearted movie becomes too serious. The audience, who was all chuckles before, suddenly didn\'t know how to react to violent situations and dangerous people. I can\'t say the movie would have been successful without this situation. IT still concerns a man who it is hard to like. But adding dark elements to a comedy and then returning to the comedy does not seem to work. The seemingly upbeat ending, too, seems fastened on. The filmmakers wanted to end on a note of hope, so they stuck in a rather cliché sentiment that does not add much to either the story or the overall theme. I have enjoyed many movies about oddballs and social outcasts, but this one just does not manage to reconcile its story elements and its themes. I wasn\'t crazy about the source material either.PS: Who came up with the advertising image of two men at a urinal? What are people making of it?', ""The definition of a comedy is: a (type of) film, play, or book that is intentionally funny either in its characters or its action. So that be said, I would think Wilson has to make me laugh at least once, or if not a true laugh at least a smile. Well guess what, none of the above occurred. And that's not because I have no sense of humor, not at all, I can pretend I have a pretty good sense of humor. But Wilson is just not funny, not even slightly. If I had to live with somebody like Wilson I would probably beat him up and end in prison. That's how annoying that character is. Extremely annoying but absolutely not funny. The acting is okay though. If they asked Woody Harrelson to play an extremely annoying person then he managed it very well. The story is long and boring, you just wait for the movie to finish, as quick as possible. Will I ever watch this movie again? If I have problems falling asleep maybe."", ""Not sure why this movie would even be considered a comedy, when in fact it had a very surreal flow to the story. I love movies like this because in the world in my head, I would love to be unfiltered like Woody was, with a heart of gold and speak my mind and, not have to worry about how other people my feel. Especially with my dickhead employer. For me this was a nice dramadey, and I don't agree with the other reviews about Harrelson not be able to save this film. In my opinion I loved his character and the rest of the cast. For a man to find out he has a child giving up to adoption and then trying to build a relationship with her, and for the child not to have a built up resentment towards their biological parents, is a very powerful message of relationship on the big screen. I have a on going visitation battle right now with my ex-wife from hell, and I swear, I'm fighting everyday to keep the relationship between me and my daughter alive. So to all you reviewers who didn't like Woody's role. I'm sorry this movie spoke volume to me. And to all you mothers and fathers out there that are not in your child's life they way you should be, Its time to really step up and man up....Great film"", ""Before i decided to watch this movie i read some IMDb reviews. It was a mixed bunch and i wanted to see it because i believed in the positive ones. Now that i have seen it, i can say they were totally right.Wilson is the story of an ordinary man who doesn't really want to take part in our modern society, mainly because of technology taking away social interactions. The movie does well in showing us the perverted lifestyle we developed because of technologies and capitalism. It made me think about these topics a lot and even affected me personally.I shed quiet a lot of tears, i was cought off guard by the movie and that is something i do not experience a lot.I would not describe this movie as a pure comedy, for me it is like 60% Drama and 40% comedy. In my opinion Wilson deserves a way higher rating."", ""This movie had me laughing so much I'm gonna have to watch it again because I missed some of the dialog due to not being able to stop laughing. There is a lot of foul language because Woody's character has no filter, and that's part of the humor. Unlike most movies made these days, there's a purpose and method to the language. It's not just foul language for the sake of foul language. Having said that, it's probably best to watch alone, or with someone you know is not sensitive to foul language. Woody does an excellent job with his character, although I get the feeling it wasn't much of a stretch for him. This may be the best I've seen from Woody. Excellent movie!"", 'Big movie, big surprise. Pure emotions, something different on the sky.', 'Wilson is the ""feel good comedy of the year"" filled with interesting characters, quirky places and anchored by a strong, unique and Oscar-worthy performance by Woody Harrelson.April FoolsWhat a mess this movie is. \xa0It tries so hard to be a ""quirky comedy"" that it focuses all of it\'s attention on the quirk and very little on what makes quirky comedies work - the characters.Let\'s start with the biggest problem with this film - the central performance of Woody Harrelson as the titular Wilson. \xa0When we first see him, he is a ""get off my lawn"" grumpy old man. \xa0In the next scene, he is an inappropriate ""close talker"", in the next it seems he has no filter. \xa0In the next, he has a childlike wonder. \xa0All of these adds up to various ""quirks"" of the character, but none of them equal a character. \xa0What they do is confuse the audience as to what kind of character they are watching. \xa0So when Wilson finally has the heart-breaking moment that will change him - we are left to wonder if he is changed for the better, or the worse or is he even changed. \xa0And I concluded with the worst comment of all...I don\'t care.This film is based on a graphic novel and a screenplay by Daniel Clowes (Ghost World) and the Direction is by Craig Johnson (The Skeleton Twins) - both of whom has done good work in the past, but this just isn\'t. \xa0The direction is all over the board bouncing from comedy to drama, but mostly landing in some mediocre middle area between the two, which drains the emotion from the proceedings. \xa0Writer Clowes must know this character in his head, and I\'m sure it makes sense to him, but it sure didn\'t to me and this effort fails miserably.There are some redeeming qualities, as the film is filled with strong performers in the supporting roles filled with the likes of Margot Martindale, Judy Greer, Mary Lynn Rajskub and Cheryl Hines, but they are on the screen all too briefly and I would have liked to have seen a film digging deeper into these characters (without Wilson). \xa0Only Laura Dern, as Wilson\'s ex-wife, acquits herself well. \xa0Her damaged, healing soul\xa0was the lone bright spot that made me sit up whenever she was on the screen.This movie was filmed in the Twin Cities, so at least I had some fun picking out the locations on the screen.\xa0 Unfortunately, the filmmakers, again, went for ""quirky"" so I become very cynical about what location was coming up next. \xa0I have the feeling the location scout was told to find ""the odd, the weird and the quirky"" in the Twin Cities. \xa0And, with that, they were successful.Letter Grade: \xa0C-3 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)', ""Imagine how hard it must be to make a film about an obnoxious self-obsessed neurotic nobody. Maybe add several equally unlikeable characters then tell a story that starts and ends nowhere special with little of interest happening in between. This is the film Wilson (2017) and calling it a black comedy does nothing to lighten its dead weight. But it begs the question: why was this film made?There are two ways to read Wilson and both depend on your threshold for finding people unbearable. Wilson (Woody Harrelson) is either a radically honest out-of-the-ballpark quirky communicator who has no filters, boundaries or respect for the normal conventions of social interaction; or he is a toxic human being who you would avoid at all costs. Or perhaps he is both. When his father dies, he is confronted by the ultimate existential crisis: divorced, alone and unloved, he ponders what does his life mean? He tracks down his ex-wife who he has not seen for 17 years in the hope that some spark of affection might be rekindled. She has not had an easy life, having been a 'crack whore' and a streetwalker. As if mentioning a mutual acquaintance they once knew, she tells him she had baby girl 17 years ago who was put up for adoption. Wilson's emotional world implodes and the rest of the film tracks his pathetic efforts to reclaim his alienated daughter and become the father he always hoped to be. In the final scenes, the story jumps to his release from jail after serving time for kidnapping his daughter, and we are meant to celebrate the reluctant reunion in a kind of 'blood is thicker than water' moral finale to this pointless story.Conventional film review criteria like characterisation, filming and narrative coherence seem irrelevant for a story based on repulsive people doing stupid things. The dialogue is trite and unfunny, and attempts at absurdist humour fall flat, or worse, are alienating. For example, when Wilson enters a near-empty train carriage to pester a stranger with intrusive and out-of-place questions, we squirm with discomfort as we do when he ridiculously gawks at a stranger urinating. His insistence on paternal rights irrespective of his daughter's needs verges on irrational psychological abuse. There are many reasons to dislike this film, including the laboured sexual references disguised as humour and the implied linking of his daughter's body-image issues to her adoption. If there is hidden meaning in Wilson, this reviewer has failed to find it."", ""The movie didn't make much sense to me. Maybe after a second watch i would understand it better. That makes the movie unwatchable. My friend gave it a 5.8 had some laughs, maybe he is older and understands the human relationships more.2/10 from me and 5.8 from him."", ""Have you ever met a person that was always so negative; a complete narcissist; a complete nut case who goes about doing all the wrong things, and makes the worst life choices ever? Well, if you do know a person like that and want to compare them to someone else as neurotic, Wilson is the movie for you. Woody Harrelson plays the titular title character with as much pizazz and life as possible while being an inherently bleak as can be.Harrelson's Wilson can best be described as the ultimate misanthrope. Nevermind Ebenezer Scrooge, Wilson is the real deal when it comes to pessimism. Taking the world with less than a grain of salt, Wilson tackles the world with the most obvious sense of negativity, blaming people and society for all that's gone wrong in his life, including his; love life, family life and most of all, all of his own quirks and habits. Don't believe us? Just pay close attention to one very short and emotionally draining scene where Wilson visits his father on his deathbed. Like so many cases after this scene, Wilson seeks for retribution and peace in all the wrong places and times.Clearly the oddball in his almost picturesque Minnesota community, Wilson's world shakes and shatters upon the discovery that an old flame and frequent drug user Pippi (Laura Dern) decided to keep a child they had together, who later independently decided to put the girl up for adaption. Upon the discovery of Pippi, and some sort of hope that the once love would rekindle, Wilson takes it upon himself to find his daughter Claire (Isabella Amara) and the beautiful urban family who has taken the responsibility to raise Claire as their own. As expected, in the most distasteful and awkward way possible, Wilson, along with Pippi, make it a hobby to include themselves in Claire's life almost forcefully.Having an almost crude and grimy way of connecting with humanity as a whole, Wilson makes good-intentioned decision to involve himself in Claire's life, until things begins to spiral out of control, in familiar Wilson-fashion, leading Wilson to state penitentiary.Luckily for us, Harrelson, one of the most versatile and interesting actors working today, allows Wilson to be a very engaging and interesting character film, focusing on the ideas of longing and loneliness. While we were fortunate enough to have the film written by Daniel Clowes, the original author of which the graphic novel the film is based off of, and Craig Johnson, director of the totally off-beat but satisfying tragic comedy The Skeleton Twins, Clowes and Johnson are able to keep the spunkiness of the almost two hour film somewhat light, keeping its flowing characters in serious need of redemption mostly entertaining and engaging.Do not get it twisted, Wilson is a very dark and comedic film, just not dark in the sense that depression and pill popping may ensue after. While Clowes has a knack of making really funny situations and characters depressing and almost unchangeable, Wilson does progress towards a satisfying yet, in its own way, Hollywood ending. While I did long for a more in-depth look or analysis of Wilson's relationship with his father, it never comes.While Wilson showcases the many levels and various temperaments of a very flawed and almost unlikable character, by the end of the film, one cannot help to kinda/sorta fall in love with Wilson. There is an illustrious comedic poignancy of the man who barely reaps the benefits of all of life's wonderful yet disillusioning obstacles. Decorated with slight glimpses of retribution for our beloved inane character, the world in which Wilson longs for is one that is slightly unattainable, yet charmingly whimsical.Harrelson is an actor that can pretty well play anything and anyone. Slap on a pair of thick framed glasses, a shaggy silver-laced beard and Harrelson nails all of the nuances of a impulsive man for whom bell tolls for on a daily basis, blowing up everything and everyone in his crazy and directionless path.Luckily for Clowes and Johnson (the original author of the source material and director) were able to assembler a quite impressive cast for a Sundance and indie darling. With the likes of Harrelson, Dern, Cheryl Hines and Judy Greer, giving a well needed spunk and kick in the ass to a somewhat joyless narrative, despite some uncomfortably appealing scenes of Wilson within a school playground and pet shop parking lot.Overall, Wilson may probably not be your most beloved feature of 2017, nor will it be your most memorable. Luckily for us, art is always a reflection of the images we see on screen, and if there is anything Wilson does well, its reminding us that there is light at the end of the tunnel; and no matter how bad things may end up looking or really are, hope, happiness and redemption is always in store, just don't squander on the opportunities once they becomes apparent."", 'If anything Wilson, the story of a lonely middle-aged man reuniting with his estranged wife to meet his daughter for the first time, accomplishes something no movie has ever done. It manages to take Woody Harrelson, a jewel of the large and small screen, and make him wholly unlikable. This is no easy feat, especially considering that his character\'s only real crime is being a watered-down Marc Maron caricature. The man cavalierly ponders the big questions and graciously oozes cookie cutter wisdom to anyone within earshot. He thinks he\'s being avuncular but really he\'s just being really, really annoying.This problem extends to the film itself. It thinks it\'s intelligent and it thinks it\'s giving us earth-shattering insights into the human condition. It lazily employs an unstructured narrative of Wilson-centric coming-of-age clichés and pads its screen time with tonally discordant moments that fly at you fast then disappear without consequence. The results is a frustrating soup of characters, conflicts, themes and rickety-old shtick that goes no where and accomplishes nothing.Of course this could be the point; the movie purports to be about life. Ergo, if life is messy then so is this movie. Yet the films total lack of focus seeps to its DNA with scenes and plot points that announce themselves as loudly as possible and climax too quickly. In one scene, Wilson (Harrelson) learns that his only two friends (Rajskub and Gelman) are moving to St. Louis. He doesn\'t take it well, prodding them until they erupt in what felt like years of pent-up frustration. It\'s a good little scene but we\'re never given any time to savor it before the movie switches gears like the slides of a carousel projector.And at the front giving the presentation is Wilson who, for better or worse is the smartest person in the film. No one dares call him out on his bulls**t, especially not Pippi (Dern) his wife who\'s just barely keeping things together after a series of bad life choices. At times, she reacts like a prisoner to Wilson\'s somewhat terrifying mid-life crisis. But by the end of the story she succumbs to the idea that her surly former lover may just be wiser beyond his years.Yeah no, the man\'s a petulant, mean-spirited, less clever, less literate Bukowski character made near-flesh by someone who saw a Woody Allen movie once and thought, ""gee, how can I take out all this pesky pithiness."" I guess in that regard Wilson can be accredited for one more accomplishment. It managed to take the daily struggles of a middle-aged white man and make them appear trivial and redundant.', 'In the beginning of ""Wilson,"" Woody Harrelson\'s loser character laments the rise of people on social media and zoning out listening to earbuds, mourning the death of human interaction. Then, he shows us the reason why people listen to headphones in public: so they don\'t get in inane conversations with people like him. As with Ghost World (and Art School Confidential, less successfully) Daniel Clowes adapts his basically plot less comic into a feature length film, shoehorning a plot into what was just a character piece. Really, this is just the misadventures of a socially awkward, overly truthful, but extroverted person. But the pinned on plot concerns Wilson reuniting with his troubled ex, finding their bullied daughter who\'d been adopted away, getting in trouble for contacting said daughter, and forming a new relationship with a yoga instructor. When his reunion with his daughter goes south, this previously lighthearted movie becomes too serious. The audience, who was all chuckles before, suddenly didn\'t know how to react to violent situations and dangerous people. I can\'t say the movie would have been successful without this situation. IT still concerns a man who it is hard to like. But adding dark elements to a comedy and then returning to the comedy does not seem to work. The seemingly upbeat ending, too, seems fastened on. The filmmakers wanted to end on a note of hope, so they stuck in a rather cliché sentiment that does not add much to either the story or the overall theme. I have enjoyed many movies about oddballs and social outcasts, but this one just does not manage to reconcile its story elements and its themes. I wasn\'t crazy about the source material either.PS: Who came up with the advertising image of two men at a urinal? What are people making of it?', ""The definition of a comedy is: a (type of) film, play, or book that is intentionally funny either in its characters or its action. So that be said, I would think Wilson has to make me laugh at least once, or if not a true laugh at least a smile. Well guess what, none of the above occurred. And that's not because I have no sense of humor, not at all, I can pretend I have a pretty good sense of humor. But Wilson is just not funny, not even slightly. If I had to live with somebody like Wilson I would probably beat him up and end in prison. That's how annoying that character is. Extremely annoying but absolutely not funny. The acting is okay though. If they asked Woody Harrelson to play an extremely annoying person then he managed it very well. The story is long and boring, you just wait for the movie to finish, as quick as possible. Will I ever watch this movie again? If I have problems falling asleep maybe."", ""Not sure why this movie would even be considered a comedy, when in fact it had a very surreal flow to the story. I love movies like this because in the world in my head, I would love to be unfiltered like Woody was, with a heart of gold and speak my mind and, not have to worry about how other people my feel. Especially with my dickhead employer. For me this was a nice dramadey, and I don't agree with the other reviews about Harrelson not be able to save this film. In my opinion I loved his character and the rest of the cast. For a man to find out he has a child giving up to adoption and then trying to build a relationship with her, and for the child not to have a built up resentment towards their biological parents, is a very powerful message of relationship on the big screen. I have a on going visitation battle right now with my ex-wife from hell, and I swear, I'm fighting everyday to keep the relationship between me and my daughter alive. So to all you reviewers who didn't like Woody's role. I'm sorry this movie spoke volume to me. And to all you mothers and fathers out there that are not in your child's life they way you should be, Its time to really step up and man up....Great film"", ""Before i decided to watch this movie i read some IMDb reviews. It was a mixed bunch and i wanted to see it because i believed in the positive ones. Now that i have seen it, i can say they were totally right.Wilson is the story of an ordinary man who doesn't really want to take part in our modern society, mainly because of technology taking away social interactions. The movie does well in showing us the perverted lifestyle we developed because of technologies and capitalism. It made me think about these topics a lot and even affected me personally.I shed quiet a lot of tears, i was cought off guard by the movie and that is something i do not experience a lot.I would not describe this movie as a pure comedy, for me it is like 60% Drama and 40% comedy. In my opinion Wilson deserves a way higher rating."", ""This movie had me laughing so much I'm gonna have to watch it again because I missed some of the dialog due to not being able to stop laughing. There is a lot of foul language because Woody's character has no filter, and that's part of the humor. Unlike most movies made these days, there's a purpose and method to the language. It's not just foul language for the sake of foul language. Having said that, it's probably best to watch alone, or with someone you know is not sensitive to foul language. Woody does an excellent job with his character, although I get the feeling it wasn't much of a stretch for him. This may be the best I've seen from Woody.

Stereotypes abound. And given that the down-home setting is West Virginia, the story is fairly insulting.The script implies that Americans who do not live on the West Coast or the East Coast are simple-minded, unsophisticated dolts that idolize Hollywood sophistication. Wow! The corporate suit that approved money for this film is dreadfully out of touch, and needs to get out of Tinseltown, fast.Nothing in the script is credible, not the characters, not the plot, not the dialogue.

And the soundtrack is irritatingly hip.With the exception of Topher Grace (miscast as Rosalee's supermarket boss), the actors overact their roles, in an apparent effort to force humor into the film. Actually, the DVD outtakes are funnier than anything in the film. Nathan Lane is marginally tolerable as a Hollywood bigwig.

They, alone, are worth the hour and a half this movie takes up of your life.As for the rest...well...the main characters in West Virginia are supposedly in their early twenties, but they all talk and act like they\'re freshmen in high school. I can\'t tell if that was a deliberate choice in dialog, a problem in casting or an obscene swipe at the ""simplicity of the rural folk,"" known to those on the coasts as ""the great flyover.""

When he ends up falling in love, her life is turned upside down when he comes to her small hometown, and gets into a competition with her best friend (Topher Grace), who is also in love with her.Generic story aside, the film is actually pretty decent. It isn\'t great or original but fans of the genre should enjoy it. The film works better than it should thanks to its young and charming cast. They all play likable characters and you will be rooting for them. Kate Bosworth is very charming and beautiful as Rosalee. Her character is very sweet and its hard to hate her though she may be a little too pretty for the role. Josh Duhamel plays Tad and he gives a decent performance. Topher Grace is very funny and entertaining as Pete. His sarcastic sense of humor starts getting old near the end of the film though. The supporting actors are also pretty good. Nathan Lane and Sean Hayes play Tad\'s agents and they both give funny performances.Besides for the impressive cast, there isn\'t much more to recommend. The story is pretty stale and predictable. You can predict what will happen just by watching the trailer. The music is very annoying and corny. The dialog is very cheesy and lame. The film is also kind of dull because you know where things are going and they add a bunch of pointless scenes. Robert Luketic brought us the very enjoyable Legally Blonde but he doesn\'t quite score a win with this film. His direction is uneven and a bit clumsy. I\'m being a little too harsh on this film.

I didn't root for either couple to stay with her, because I couldn't believe that either character would have been interested in her. Her first scenes when she met Tad were extremely cheesy, and her annoying accent when conversing with Pete was too much to handle.

It\'s a brainless, cutesy little romantic comedy -- but that\'s okay since it doesn\'t try to be anything deep or uber meaningful. Topher Grace does a good job playing the sort of nerdy-uber romantic-always crushing on cheerleaders but never having one as a girlfriend guy. It seems to be a really natural performance, possible too natural? ;) Just kidding. But honestly, he does as good of a job as any guy can do in a movie that is totally geared towards the female population. Needless to say, the moral of this story is pretty obvious and it\'s one we\'ve seen at least a gazillion times before. But I liked it and it\'s perfect if you\'re looking for something that requires no brain power at all.', 'This movie is definitely a ""chick flick."" Both male leads are played pretty well. Josh Duhamel portrays the self-absorbed actor well, but has difficulty being believable when he is supposedly being sincere. Of course, maybe that\'s the point. Topher Grace, on the other hand, is able to portray an emotion in very subtle ways, and is therefore perfect as the inwardly-tortured old friend. Kate Bosworth\'s character seems to be quite one-dimensional, and not always consistently. She is overly naive, even for a small town hick. I get the impression that the Hollywood types who wrote her part have never been to a small town, or at least, not since the 50s. There are sweet, wholesome people in this world, but they are more realistic than this girl. It is difficult to ascertain who the protagonist is. Is it Topher or Kate? His character has more depth than hers, but it appears that the story revolves around her. Nathan Lane and Sean Hayes provide much-needed comedy and interest to the story. I found myself looking forward to their appearances on-screen. Funny moments and a few good performances make it worthwhile, but I definitely believe it will appeal more to us women than the men.', ""I admit it.  I saw this movie simply because I wanted to see something light and fluffy.  I got what I wanted.  Yes, it's a chick flick.  Yes, it's predictable.  Yes, it has the typical Hollywood ending.  But the film never said it was going to be anything but that, and that's why I liked it.  No political agendas.  No heavy drama and/or gut-wrenching scenes.  In fact, there really wasn't anything in this film that was really negative.  It was just a cute, fluffy little film that was intended to make you fill light-hearted when it was over.  And for me, that is exactly what it did.  Rank: 8"", ""So, if you're looking for a movie similar to the Pianist or Road to Perdition this is not the movie to see; but, if what you seek is a fun and upbeat romantic comedy that can serve as an hour and a half long distraction from reality then you have come to the right place.  Win a Date with Tad Hamilton is amusing and funny and the young stars are successfully endearing.  Audience members will not walk out of the theater after viewing this movie intellectually enlightened but that is not the movies intention. After viewing this movie you will leave the theater feeling happy and optimistic (which is a feat in today's society).  Topher Grace and Kate Bosworth are adorable as typical Midwesterners (even if, as a Midwesterner myself I can attest to the fact that they are still a little too Hollywood to fully pass as West Virginian Piggly Wiggly workers).  Basically, go to see Win a Date with Tad Hamilton if you want to you want a small morsel to make you temporarily blissful and please, please do not hold it to standards that it is not trying to meet.

I liked Josh Duhamel too, and was interested to find that he really wasn't the stereotypical movie star trying to manipulate Kate Bosworth.

In fact if they replace the subtitles and voice over with a Radiohead album you would get a much better result."", ""Long (TOO long) story of two angels (dressed in black) walking among the people of Berlin--hearing their innermost thoughts and desires.  Most people can't see them--only children and the young at heart     One of them falls in love and wants to become human again.  Of course that doesn't happen until 90 MINUTES have elapsed!Obviously, this film takes it's sweet time even setting up a plot.  For a full hour and half you see the angels walking around and hearing what they hear.  It's all somber and shot in black & white which makes it all the more depressing.  After 90 minutes I was bored and very depressed.  As other posters have said it DOES have some incredible imagery--but it's not attractive imagery.  It's all bleak and desolate.  Also the slow pace makes this very difficult to sit through.  It seems director Wim Wenders believes a film has to be slow and bleak to be art.  Well, that doesn't make it art...it makes it slow and bleak!  The acting is also pretty bad...but the director is obviously more concerned about images than acting.  And the nonstop thoughts you hear make little sense and NEVER stop! The only bright spots are some beautiful color photography and Peter Falk who is obviously enjoying himself...but damned if I knew what he was doing in this!I'm giving it a 4--and that's just for the photography.  This is basically a very overrated, pretentious film that THINKS it's making an artistic statement.  The late Pauline Kael nailed it in her review of it in the New Yorker back in 1988--she said a friend of hers didn't want the movie to end...but couldn't wait to get out of the theatre!"", ""Similar to Pleasantville or going back, The Wizard of Oz, the cinematography changes from bleak black and white during the angel and angst scenes to rather sober color during the romantic moments of human desire. Does it work? Well, Wim Wenders probably spent too much time reading Thomas Mann or Sartre while taking in some Wagner because none of the philosophical meanderings makes much sense even to an elitist intellectual, but I digress.Bruno Ganz is a tall angel that wanders unseen amidst the citizens of Berlin. It's the eve of the Velvet Revolution. The wall is still there, almost in every scene with its Jasper Johns-like-graffiti. The citizens think aloud sad sophistry's on the disappointment that life presents. Not one says anything remotely Christian as though the main religion of Europe never existed; rather, Existentialism just seeps through their pores as they contemplate the destruction of Berlin during Allied bombing raids \x96 these shown in old newsreels.Then Peter Folk or Colombo (hard to say which) shows up to be in a concentration camp movie with Nazi uniforms and Jewish prisoners. The angel is a movie fan. Does Falk add to the film in any way? He is humorous, but he mumbles the same Existential pap as everyone else.This one is an art house film, beautifully shot without a standard plot. I'll give it that much."", ""Anyway, I am incredibly ashamed to say, that at about one hour or so into the film, I...turned it off. I had a lot of stuff to do today, and there were a lot of factors that contributed to my turning it off, but mostly it was because the movie was completely uninteresting. I'm all for beautiful cinematography, and poetry, etc etc (for example, I recently enjoyed The New World, which was very similar in that it consisted mostly of beautiful scenery and poetic, inner thoughts), but it really wasn't working for me here. First off...why was every single person in Berlin so damn depressed? Honestly? ...and why would an angel have any desire to become human after listening to all those depressed (and ridiculously 'philosophic') inner-thoughts all day? It was turning out to be this quasi-intellectual, 'art' film that I've come to despise. I love art. Yeay art! ...but when it comes to film as art, the artistic vision needs to blend with something called...a story; and ideally, an interesting one...perhaps, with dialogue, or at least some rational, 'normal' people inner thoughts (the inner-thoughts of David Spritz in The Weather Man, for example). Grrr, I don't know...I'm angry by the fact that so many people find a movie like this good just because it is 'artsy'. Anybody can make a really pretty, 'intellectual' movie...just spend all your time framing nice shots, lighting the set just right, and adding giving your characters dialogue straight out of a philosophy book...nevermind the plot, or acting, or, dare I say it...entertainment value? WHAT?! A movie can be artistic AND entertaining at once? You don't say?!"", 'After seeing the very high ratings I went to see this film expecting something wonderful. Now after reading the rave reviews I am compelled to write about how different I felt. I had a very hard time sitting through this one as did several audience members who actually left the theatre. I really wanted to identify with or understand what these ""people"" were thinking or doing but felt totally uninspired which is I guess what the director wanted me to be. For the most part this film was dreary and for the the first half much too elongated with the characters going into great detail about their feelings. Do most people go through that much highly advanced thought processes about such deep issues or did these angels just get lucky to find special subjects. Being a big Peter Falk fan I was delighted to see him as the only great thing about this movie as he turned in a terrific performance. Even for one in the top 250 there\'s got to be someone who thinks it\'s mediocre!', ""I've been going through the lists of best films and best foreign films and renting those that I hadn't yet seen. I expected more from this movie. It starts out very slowly, and never really speeds up.Obviously, the American City of Angels is based on this film: an angel gets tired of not being a part of the world he's always watching and wants to become human to be with a woman he's in love with. Unfortunately, the love affair isn't as important in this film, and the characters aren't as likable IMO.My husband could only sit through half this movie before giving up. I could appreciate the artistry of the film and liked the ties to the Nazi occupation. The way that so many different lives are shown is interesting but overdone. I got the gist of it in the first five minutes and didn't need another hour of the same thing."", ""Many reviewers here fawn over this film and dismiss anyone who does not share their worship as being juvenile or a philistine. I've watched enough films to know whether a film is truly profound or whether it is pretentious. Wings of Desire sways towards the latter.It has a great premise- angels (not winged creatures but men in cool black coats, similar to the portrayal of the dead in Orphee) watch over late eighties Berlin, observing the humans they see around them. One angel (Bruno Ganz) falls in love with a mortal trapeze artist (Solveig Dommartin). You would think that this would be a winning formula and therefore a brilliant film. I was disappointed to find out that although it may not be a bad film, it is by no means a brilliant one.The cinematography is great, although the monochrome angels and technicolour humans had already been done 40 years previously. We get some great shots of urban Berlin, which gives the film an interesting cultural context. It almost acts as a time capsule, and had Wenders concentrated on this aspect of the film, the film would not seem as unfocused and vague as it does.The worst part of the film is the dialogue, which is pseudo-philosophical naval gazing. I don't mind introspective dialogue but when every sentence is some vague existential musing, I tend to tune out, which is fatal for this film as the action is essentially in their internal monologues. The trapeze artist's final monologue could have worked had the whole film not been composed in that way but the monologue is basically a repetition of what has been constantly repeated throughout the film. Some arty types might forgive this because they see it as some universal truth but for most, it is simply repetitive to the point at which it becomes meaningless.I forgot the love story! Seems that Wenders did that too because it only makes an appearance in the last half-hour or so of the film, although there were tiny hints earlier on. Because the romance is so unprominent for most of the film, when it finally comes to it, you wonder why the film was two hours long and not one hour. Apart from the misjudged monologue by the trapeze artist, it is quite a romantic scene. Her dress is stunning.Potentially a great thought-provoking film but self-indulgence on the director's/writers' part causes the film to feel unfocused and vague. The film tries to deny its artificiality by adding in lots of 'profound' dialogue but there are many points in the film where it comes off as very superficial. It's a bit like a New Romantic pop video."", 'Digging deep into the thoughts and dreams of mortals and the angels who look after them, WINGS OF DESIRE is a masterfully-made work of art and Germany\'s finest. It matches lavish cinematography, flawless direction by Wim Winders, impressive performances and a simple plot told with such brilliance, symbolism and will.The first half of the film resembles more like a beautifully-painted mosaic or an avant-garde film showing empathy for every character brought about by the screen even showing traces of the Nazism era. Here, the idea of supernatural beings that indirectly assist humans in day-to-day life is introduced. The mystifying beings are unseen to everyone except to the young-at-heart. Hovering atop statues or wandering inside public libraries or apartments, they see and know everything as Winders etches the black-and-white world of the angels. The story evolves when one angel Damiel (Bruno Ganz) wonders what it is like to be human, how it is like to be able to feel, to hold or to be seen. Once he comes to the aid of attractive trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin), he feels a spiritual devotion he has never felt before.Winders\' slow-but-steady rate gives time for the viewer to contemplate on the questions a child asks (""Why am I me and why not you? Why am I here and not there? When did time begin and where did space end?""). He allows the audience members think what they want to think in a new light instead of manipulating them. The scenario of a ghostly being falling for a human may seem overworked now (GHOST, JUST LIKE HEAVEN) but WINGS OF DESIRE is a fresh, innovative piece of cinema with remarkable photography and unbelievable performances. Henry Alekan\'s cinematography is both insightful and visually dazzling. Every camera angle takes on a new connotation. Ganz and Dommartin are equally irresistible as two different ""people"", who worlds apart from each other; both characters are looking for love, no matter how close Damien is from Marion. Peter Falk, playing himself, is an amusing attribute to the cast being ""Columbo"" in the popular TV show. Being a mysterious character himself, he metaphorically adds a little color to the film amidst all the spellbinding drama and discloses an entertaining revelation that helps the film progress.This revolutionary masterpiece of craftsmanship is considered by many as the greatest non-US movie ever and it deserves all of its praise entirely. WINGS OF DESIRE breaks new ground in romantic and dramatic film making. Every scene in this movie offers a chance for hope, understanding and compassion. Unbearably creative, outstanding and poignant, this superbly-made motion picture is not another art-house flick. Astounding.WINGS OF DESIRE was remade in Hollywood as the sleek yet disappointing CITY OF ANGELS(1997).', 'A visually beautiful film, which boasts one of the most poetic and literary scripts ever- the dreamlike poetry of the dialogue fits seamlessly in with the overpowering visuals. The acting is of very high callibre too, with Peter Falk adding a very welcome dimension to the film and Bruno Ganz proving a master at acting via expression and nuance. The storyline is nice and simple and is given much additional poignancy and depth by the way Wenders directed, Henri Alekan photographed and the choice of music for certain scenes- the use of Nick Cave\'s ""The Carney"" is especially perfect for the scene in which it was used, as was the music during the main scene where we get to see Marion\'s Trapeze act- the music, visual mastery and the act itself combine to stunningly entrancing effect. That 100 people have given this film a 1/10 mark is almost beyond belief, as it is an absolute joy from start to finish. Rating:- ***** (out of *****)', 'If my grandchildren ever ask me what it was like back in the Cold War, I\'ll tell them to watch this movie. It is both frighteningly bleak and lyrically beautiful. It captures the spirit of the times (Western civilization immediately before the fall of the Berlin Wall) better than any movie I\'ve ever seen. And it manages to be a love letter to those times while also showing the place and time in all its inescapable ugliness. The overall plot moves forward pretty nicely for a movie where plot doesn\'t seem to matter all that much, and there are some beautiful vignettes, beautifully photographed, acted, and directed. I\'m not sure how anyone can make it through the movie without falling in love with Bruno Ganz\'s angel. I think the movie\'s lyricism holds up well on multiple viewing -- as long as you liked it the first time. If the self-consciously art-house form bugs you, however, or you find the screenplay\'s ""poetry"" to be too facile, you\'ll probably find this movie grating. I, however, have never seen people reading silently in a public library without thinking of this movie . . . .', 'It\'s amazing that any non-German speakers can even appreciate this movie. True the basic story is universal and beautiful, but it\'s Peter Handke\'s poetry that makes it breathtaking. Wenders had done other Handke works in film - Alice in the Cities, The Lefthanded Woman, The Goalie\'s fear of the Penalty- but this one is very different.This movie is about giving up the ethereal life of the observer and actually living it.

Wishful Thinking,2.67,4.0,"['Comedy', 'Romance']","Elizabeth, a vet assistant, falls for Max, who brings in an abused dog. His jealousy burdens their relationship as does talk of marriage. Lena wants Max and she schemes.",sadness,"[""'Wishful Thinking' was shown on TV last night, with more appearing after midnight than before. I'm afraid I was rather tired, and dozed off here and there. I do not recommend napping during this title, as there is so much of the content which the viewer needs to tie together. There isn't much padding. Fortunately, I was smart enough to record this title in case it was worth a review, and I'm glad I did. I watched it again this morning, and made so much more of it now that I'm in more awake mode.The plot is based around a quintet's relationships: three guys and two girls. I found all of the characters interesting. True to real life, each displayed virtues and vices. As far as I'm concerned, this does qualify as a comedy. It is not the slapstick variety, but a quiet sense of humour, which amused me, pervades the movie. I'm not so sure that it is a romantic comedy, because the romance isn't really touching enough, but I wouldn't call it unromantic.The whole quintet played their parts well, and which of them we prefer will depend on our outlook on life. Elizabeth (Jennifer Beals) was the character I liked best. There was something very charming and commendable about Elizabeth, and I will look forward to seeing Jennifer Beals again on my screen if she has done any similar work. I also enjoyed Henry (Jon Stewart), a character of depth whose company would be great fun and appreciated by everybody.I'm no expert, so what I am about to say concerning the film's director, Adam Park, may reap disdain from those more knowledgeable than I, those having different tastes, or those who have a different understanding of life. I thought the director did a great job in many respects. Like 'Pleasantville', the clever use of colour and monochrome added an extra dimension. There were plenty of facial close-ups, which I need to get a good feel for a character. Continuity might seem somewhat disjointed, but that is the nature of this beast. In fact, the viewer is steadily gaining more of the overall picture throughout. I would like to make three points in particular: (i) This film is well structured, but demands intelligence and alertness from the audience. Other reviews indicate that it is easy to lose track of the action, and some will fail to make the necessary connections. (ii) The ending, shown concurrently with the credits, gives a strong indication as to how events pan out, but it wasn't sufficiently conclusive for me. As a person who loves everything properly wrapped up and with a happy-ever-after ending, I didn't have full confidence in the enduring quality of the suggested final relationships. I'm willing to grant that they might be promising, however. (iii) Particularly as the writing credits were attributed to the director, please take note that a significant minority of us don't like effing in the scripts, of which there were about five bouts in 'Wishful Thinking'. Also, cheap laughs might be had by demonstrating a lack of respect for God and religion, but the serious consequences of this will only be understood by many when they inevitably meet their Maker. The moral tone, language and respect for God in a film largely determines whether or not I am willing to buy the DVD, if there is one. In this case, it would need to be exceedingly cheap to tempt me, but by that I am not suggesting this movie is without merit.To sum up, please don't judge this movie on a single viewing. It improves greatly on the second time around, and I would certainly be tempted to watch it again in a while, if and when it is re-shown."", ""The 2 good things about this film were the costume and personality that Drew Barrymore had, and the way that they  worked the 3 individuals stories into one another, which kept you a little in suspense. Other than that, this film didn't have much to offer. It wasn't romantic or funny. Not horrible either, though. I give it a 5/10 (Average)"", 'This is a cute, quirky little film, that has some pretty darned good acting performances in it. Drew Barrymore was good, and beautiful, as was Jennifer Beals. I wasn\'t very familiar with James LeGros, but he almost stole the show. Excellent characterization of ""Max"". I have to say that I did enjoy the basic device of the film, the use of different point of view characters, but the director eventually got too cutesy and that did detract from the movie.

Breaking bad had a steady beat to it starting off slow and then cranking up the story lines. Saul is a wise man in Breaking Bad but Jimmy seems to be utterly clueless. The scene were Jimmy was in Los Pollos Hermanos was the lowest point of the series to date. What on earth have the writers done to this show? I hope there is some point to this rubbish or I will have to consider if the show is worth watching. It's really starting to feel like Heroes all over again."", ""Cannot read reviews that have Spoiler Alert. Why?Good show with some very good, but not great writing. Seems to have scenes linger a bit long and sometimes with no point.Good actors who sometimes suffer from over or even underwriting. Very confusing first scene episode at the Cinnebon place.

Wolves,2.64,2.86,['Documentary'],A boy is trying to find out about his family history and stumbles upon a town of lycans.,anticipation,"['Watching the film reminded me of a Sunday afternoon Tele Movie, though I would have preferred to watch sport instead.There wasn\'t anything new in the Wolves and it got boring with all the dialogue as if the director wanted to truly make you understand the reasons behind why all this was happening. I ended up not caring and wanted the film to end.The acting wasn\'t too bad though the make-up effects were definitely made for TV and not anywhere near for theatrical release. The wolves were not scary and no where close to realistic. The story line? A basic plot where the ""hero"" tries to be the hero and ends up the hero. Quite predictable except for one scene towards the end but then some of you may already figure it out.', 'Cayden is a senior in high school and a star football player. He began developing very violent tendencies he cannot control, eventually turning to a wolfman. One night, his parents were mercilessly shredded to death in their house. Confused and guilty, Cayden takes off to escape persecution. In a random rough bar, he meets Wild Joe who knew his secret and directs him to a remote town of Lupine Range to know more about his lycan nature. There, Cayden meets his ideal match Angel, as he discovers his real nature and who his real parents were. The two young actors in the lead roles Lucas Till (as Cayden) and Merritt Patterson (as his Angel) were earnest and looked good, but they did not possess enough charismatic intensity to pull their jobs off. Their performances were merely adequate at best. Patterson though, did make a sexy she-wolf.Three more senior members of the cast had a lot more in terms of screen presence and acting chops. John Pyper-Ferguson was an over-the-top Wild Joe. Stephen McHattie played the kindly farmer John Tollerman, who takes Caiden in and stood by him during his time of self-discovery. Jason Momoa uses his muscle-bound heft and fierce looks to create the perfect Connor, the alpha wolfman of the town. There should have been more of his character.This is yet another teenage werewolf movie. However, it does not really add anything new to this often-told horror sub-genre. Instead of the CG giant wolves used in the ""Twilight"" series, the werewolves in this film used old-fashioned makeup to create the lycanthropic illusion. While the effort for detail was admirable, the ""wolves"" did not look too realistic nor scary for the big screen. The script though had surprises along the way. It did not really turn out as predictable as you may think. However, as a whole, this film had an odd throwback feel about it, like this should have been released a few decades ago. 3/5.', ""This was a hugely disappointing movie for me. The acting was atrocious, what passed for a plot was utter tripe and the effects were mediocre at best. I had more or less expected most of that but had hoped for the redemption offered by some clever tongue-in-cheek take on its own failings to provide some classic b-grade or satiric humour. Alas, no such luck. For me, the most redeeming feature of having watched this movie is that I can make that statement in the past tense. There are MUCH better offerings out there but if, like me, you enjoy a good werewolf movie, then it is unavoidable that you will end up watching this dross anyway in your ongoing search for one of those rare gems. Don't say I didn't warn you though....."", ""Cayden Richards (Lucas Till) is the high school star quarterback but he is struggling with some strange changes. After a couple of incidents including transformation, he decides to runaway. He finds out that he is adopted. He befriends Wild Joe who sends him to others at Lupine Ridge. Gail Timmins (Melanie Scrofano) is the drunken bartender. He is immediately attracted to her sister Angelina Timmins (Merritt Patterson). John Tollerman (Stephen McHattie) gives him a job at his farm. Connor (Jason Momoa) is the mysterious local gang leader.The first thing one notice is that the transformation is revealed early on and the movie doesn't enjoy showing it. It doesn't have fun with the usual werewolf transformation sequence. It's possible that they don't have the expertise or the budget to do it properly. There is a lot of werewolf makeup. Most of it is fair. This is a lower budget Canadian production and strictly a cable TV movie. Still, there are possible ways to make it work better. There is no imagination in the filmmaking and the story moves too slowly. There is nothing surprising and there isn't any tension. Instead of rushing through his origins story, they should have started Cayden on the road. His past can be shown in quick flashbacks. None of it is that compelling anyways. This is not any good."", ""Despite Stephen McHattie and Jason Mamoa bringing some gravitas to the proceedings Wolves unfortunately trundles along in unspectacular stereotypical fashion. Touching upon slightly interesting themes of the nature of the Werewolves they soon fall apart with very forced plot turns. Perhaps they were hankering after the Twilight audience and they do indeed succeed in making Twilight look better in comparison. It's all very forgettable and the makeup was a bit naff to be honest. I suggest the European filmed Wer instead of this if you are in the mood for some Wolven hijinks. If you are in the mood for mild teen angst and a script by numbers then Wolves will allow you to relax."", ""I saw that it contained a few names I have seen before at for example Game Of Thrones or Saw or other to mention. And after seen the trailer I thought that it was worth a pick up, sadly at the end of this flick I was disappointed.There wasn't any scary part or had any horror element. the effects were done CGI and when a wolf was eaten one's hand it didn't looked convincing in some ways. this is just a flick for teenagers who do like Vampire Diaries and stuff like that. Only Melanie Scrofano (Gail) shows some skin while having sex but overall this is tame. Not for me...Gore 0/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 2/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5"", ""Had kind of a Teen Wolf meets The Lost Boys kind of thing going on.I liked the fact that there was no CGI used it was all special effects and makeup, which was a nice break from todays excessive use of CGI. It's kind of what had me sold on it to be honest, the effort put into the costumes. You can see by the pictures they put a lot into the work on the wolves.I think Angelica and Cayden looked pretty sweet as wolves, They looked about as real as a human/wolf could look, certainly looked better than Jack Nicholson's Wolf.Yeah the acting wasn't spectacular, but really, when it comes to these kind of lower budget films.. It definitely isn't Underworld in that aspect but still it was a good little weekend special."", ""Looking for blockbuster CG effects? this ain't it. Your sure to be disappointed. However if your looking for something better then reality TV and Sharknado? Then this is a well done little movie, with some decent talent, although i wouldn't say the dialog or acting is Oscar worthy, The movie entertained me, i enjoyed it and most of the time that is exactly what i ask of my movies, allow me to escape to forget about my worries and dramas and enjoy some entertainment.Looking for a decent quality movie without the hype? this is it. Some decent plot twists, kept me engrossed throughout. I would recommend it for ages over 10. Biggest surprise i can't recall any f bombs ... hmmm maybe i'm just desensitized to it these days."", ""Does a good job of trying to give us the complete package.Went to see it cause it was a werewolf flick, and I have not seen many in comparison to the vampire flick.

Now, let's get to business, I'm doing this for the different kind of viewers, the curious people, the fans of the genre (you know, vampires, wolves, Supernatural, Buffy, Anne Rice, kind of genre) and the maybe negative/ skeptical people.By saying this is obviously I too am a fan of this series and books, so I know what people like to feel and watch when seen a movie that have supernatural beings. The movie is about a teenage boy who just discovered he is a werewolf, yes I know what are you thinking, more of Twilight crap, teenage lovers, perfect life, fall in love, etc. etc. but nope, because everything turns upside down as death and desolation came to the life of Lucas Till () until a estrange character does a really weird talk to him and makes him go to and even weirder small town full of people that don't like the poor teenage werewolf and things get very interesting a cooler.The movie has a very easy to understand narration, with a nice speed, and doesn't exaggerate nor waste any time trying to explain the wolves transformation or the supernatural forces behind the werewolf experience, instead it makes the viewer enjoy the experience of being a lupine, the speed, the force, enhance abilities which is something no many movies even bother to do and just portrait it as something tragic or negative as a course, whether is a vampire or wolf is practically the same result.So you get the teenage that by the way is pretty much mature and wiser kind of boy, who is forced to do this transition of boy to man/wolf to defend himself and the people he loves, and also balance his personal life with all the scenarios that a teenage may live, and yes that include sex, very ferocious, aggressive and hairy sex.About the actors and their rolls, all of them make an perfect believable non stereotypic characters which I personally enjoy very much, Lucas Till was excellent, not only did make maybe the best teenage werewolf of any movie but David Hayter's work as a director was really make me want to see more of his work for future projects, Jasom Mamoa was a force to be feared most of the time, he really pushed the other characters and made them fear him Merritt Patterson and Stephen McHattie played a great complement and pretty much all of them make a mayor roll that is like a big circle that creates a very intelligent narration with a very welcome twist at the near end.This movie has a lot of lovely moments, great characters, with very interesting backgrounds that actually make me wanted to know more about them, the story is a very good and enjoyable adventure, that opens the path to a second movie and maybe a TV series which I think know is be the perfect moment, even a prequel with Mamoa character past would be great.I think this is one of David Hayter finest works, which really put him in the level of great movie directors; I am really waiting for his next move."", ""I got this movie thinking it was going to be a cheap werewolf version of twilight but gave it a go as the other reviews were pretty positive. Have to say I was really impressed. The special effects were excellent and not CGI'd, which is a nice change.The action is kept at a good pace and although the story has been played out in a 1000 other movies I still found myself getting quite into it.As someone with a limited attention span this movie passed my mobile phone test and I didn't check eBay or Facebook once, which I have done with a few recent werewolf releases.As a werewolf fan I've had a couple of favourites lately (Wer and Late Phases) and this was up there with them.This movie isn't going to win any Oscars but it's an easy and enjoyable watch with really good monsters."", 'Watching the film reminded me of a Sunday afternoon Tele Movie, though I would have preferred to watch sport instead.There wasn\'t anything new in the Wolves and it got boring with all the dialogue as if the director wanted to truly make you understand the reasons behind why all this was happening.

The wolves were not scary and no where close to realistic. The story line? A basic plot where the ""hero"" tries to be the hero and ends up the hero. Quite predictable except for one scene towards the end but then some of you may already figure it out.', 'Cayden is a senior in high school and a star football player. He began developing very violent tendencies he cannot control, eventually turning to a wolfman. One night, his parents were mercilessly shredded to death in their house. Confused and guilty, Cayden takes off to escape persecution. In a random rough bar, he meets Wild Joe who knew his secret and directs him to a remote town of Lupine Range to know more about his lycan nature. There, Cayden meets his ideal match Angel, as he discovers his real nature and who his real parents were. The two young actors in the lead roles Lucas Till (as Cayden) and Merritt Patterson (as his Angel) were earnest and looked good, but they did not possess enough charismatic intensity to pull their jobs off. Their performances were merely adequate at best. Patterson though, did make a sexy she-wolf.Three more senior members of the cast had a lot more in terms of screen presence and acting chops. John Pyper-Ferguson was an over-the-top Wild Joe. Stephen McHattie played the kindly farmer John Tollerman, who takes Caiden in and stood by him during his time of self-discovery. Jason Momoa uses his muscle-bound heft and fierce looks to create the perfect Connor, the alpha wolfman of the town. There should have been more of his character.This is yet another teenage werewolf movie. However, it does not really add anything new to this often-told horror sub-genre. Instead of the CG giant wolves used in the ""Twilight"" series, the werewolves in this film used old-fashioned makeup to create the lycanthropic illusion. While the effort for detail was admirable, the ""wolves"" did not look too realistic nor scary for the big screen. The script though had surprises along the way. It did not really turn out as predictable as you may think. However, as a whole, this film had an odd throwback feel about it, like this should have been released a few decades ago. 3/5.', ""This was a hugely disappointing movie for me.

I had more or less expected most of that but had hoped for the redemption offered by some clever tongue-in-cheek take on its own failings to provide some classic b-grade or satiric humour. Alas, no such luck. For me, the most redeeming feature of having watched this movie is that I can make that statement in the past tense.

The special effects were excellent and not CGI'd, which is a nice change.The action is kept at a good pace and although the story has been played out in a 1000 other movies I still found myself getting quite into it.As someone with a limited attention span this movie passed my mobile phone test and I didn't check eBay or Facebook once, which I have done with a few recent werewolf releases.As a werewolf fan I've had a couple of favourites lately (Wer and Late Phases) and this was up there with them.This movie isn't going to win any Oscars but it's an easy and enjoyable watch with really good monsters.""]",42,['Documentary']
Women of the Prehistoric Planet,1.5,2.0,['Science Fiction'],"A spaceship crashes upon an unexplored planet, and the rescuers sent to search for survivors discover that decades have passed due to time dilation.",sadness,"['With a title like ""Women of the Prehistoric Planet"" I envisioned a Lost World type movie in which scantily-clad amazonian beauties ride dinosaurs, fight against half-animal savages and a harsh, unforgiving environment. But with only one women, some forced perspective lizards that com-bust on impact, and a bunch of white guys straight out of the U.S. Navy, one can only wonder what the creators of this movie were thinking when they came up with the title.To be fair, there are some legitimate scientific ideas that are dealt with in the movie, even if the writers don\'t understand how they really work. For example, the writers were correct in saying that when you travel near the speed of light time slows down, so that a three week journey for the astronauts aboard the spaceship is perceived by those on the planet as taking eighteen years. However, the perception of the people down on the planet has nothing to do with the speed of the planet\'s rotation but the way in which the planet\'s matter distorts the space time continuum.The real plot of this movie is that a spaceship (Cosmos III) is hijacked by the primitive Centurions (a.k.a., non-white people) who probably perform menial domestic services for the crew aboard the spaceship. The ship crash lands on an unexplored planet with only a few survivors. Another ship in the vicinity (Cosmos IV?), moving at nearly the speed of light, travels to rescue the survivors (a three week journey on the spaceship, but an eighteen year wait on the planet). Once on the ground a group of idiots looking like U.S. Navy officers are dispatched to find the crash site. Meanwhile, a beautiful Centurion girl (the ultra-sexy Irene Tsu as Linda) wanders off and encounters a mysterious stranger named Tang who is also a Centurion. Obviously, he\'s the son of the survivors of the crash eighteen years earlier.The story of Linda and Tang is probably the most interesting aspect of this movie. Through their adventures together they fall in love but must still deal with the tension of growing up in two very different environments. The other aspect of the plot has to do with clumsy idiots falling off logs into acid pools and shooting at anything that moves with their ultra high tech .44 pistols. The ending of this movie will surprise no one.', 'Somewhere in space, where no one can hear you scream, the Cosmos 1 is heading off to somewhere else. The crew have been on this 6 month mission. They are an advanced space faring race with their futuristic lockers and guitar-looking radar wall screen and the tendency to do space/time conversion formulas. Somewhere else another space vessel, Cosmos 3, has problems. The ship and crew are being held hostage by Centaurians (think of Klingons without the brown paint and sash, but all Asian) and because of it they crash onto a ""prehistoric"" planet.The commander of Cosmos 1, Admiral King (played by the walking corpse of the late Wendell Corey), disobeys orders and goes on a rescue mission to Solaris. 3 months later .....Cosmos 1 arrives at the planet, where 18 years have gone by. A rescue party is sent down, lead by Commander ""I don\'t like Centaurians"" Scott with Dr. Farrell (played by the incomparable John Agar), Lt.""Why won\'t he shut up"" Bradley, Stuart Margolin as the Chief and some nobody who\'s expendable (think of the red shirt security officers from the original Star Trek series). At the same time, Linda (Irene Tsu) escapes to the planet to stretch her legs.On the ""prehistoric"" planet below, they find the crash site and the lone survivor; a Centaurian named Tang (Robert Ito). The rest of the movie is just a ""stew"" containing paper machete sets, stock footage of an iguana, a rubber iguana on fire, a sock-like jumping tree snake, a hopping spider plush toy, animal cruelty towards a chimpanzee (Teeko), stock footage, the admiral\'s slurred confused alcoholic rants and a trio of cavemen brutes. We top this with scenes upon scenes of the lecherous, chauvinistic, sexual harassing, karate practicing Lt. Bradley (who never shuts up). Visualize the Watney Smith character from Outlaw of Gor .... CABOT !!Though the budget of the movie (and by proxy the intelligence of the write/director) was low, the movie still manages to be infused with a thought provoking plot about race relations, cultural differences, not being understood, being different, going through turmoil and finding a resolution. As a rule, you probably won\'t need more than 5 or 6 shots of SoCo to be able to see this.You will probably recognize some of the actors. They had long and fulfilling careers, but you would not have bet on that after seeing this movie. Riveting performances like ""crossing the log when we could go around or jump over the liquid"" scene and Irene Tsu\'s unforgettable banana scene. This scene is both erotic, inappropriate and confusing (the skin of the banana ,and by proxy the banana itself, is bite-proof, yet not peel proof). Robert Ito\'s ""hopping"" interpretation of Tang will haunt me for the rest of my days. I highly recommend this movie if you are not alone, not on any sleep inducing medication nor in possession of a dissection kit and are watching the MST3k version of this movie. In my final thoughts I noticed a similarity between this movie and another MST alumni, The Clonus Horror. Now to a bit of SAT deja vu :The Clonus Horror is to The Island as The Women of the Prehistoric Planet is to \x85. a) Star Trek b) Star Wars c) None of the above d) Battlestar Galactica.... for those even remotely interested the answer will be in my next review.-Celluloid Rehab', 'There\'s only one woman featured prominently in this movie...and she isn\'t from the prehistoric planet. What a rip-off!There are a couple of hokey effects but you\'ll want to hit the fast-forward button to see them. The majority of this film, like so many bad sci-fi movies of the 50\'s and 60\'s, is extended walking sequences!  No one ever imagined that a prehistoric planet would be this boring.  Never did a film need process shots of alligators and lizards more.  Or women, for that matter!However, it is worth noting that this is the movie that started the popular ""Hi-Keeba!!"" catch phrase on MST3K.There\'s also twist ending in this movie that the average viewer will be able to spot about 2 minutes into the film.  John Agar\'s in this film, too. \'Nuff said.', ""Perhaps the worst movie ever shown on MST3K. Misleading titled, actors who aren't believable as humans. A Cardboard set, and outright laughable special effects. I guess one could list the plot as a goof. There was something that came out of this movie that started a trend. Something we see today. Prop Advertisements. Tang, a children's fruit drink, was the name of the only one left on the planet. subliminal advertisement! What a concept.I wonder how Tang's sales were after this movie. Wait, I guess that really isn't a positive. I guess as far as this movie is concerned, the glass is really half empty. Kinda like the people's head who starred and those who wrote it. half empty. No brains, just space for rent."", 'Yoy!  Shouldn\'t there be laws against fraudulent movie titles?  The movie\'s title suggests something like ""Fire Maidens in Outer Space"", with scantily-clad women prancing here and there, doing liturgical dance and generally acting as hunk magnets for the film\'s beefy, 1950s-era heroes. Alas, such is not the case. What you get instead is something along the line of ""Beatniks"" (which had none in the movie).The film\'s premise dealing with time travel is noble, but the continuous back and forth on how many years have passed since this or that event are confusing.  John Agar stars along with Wendell Corey as leaders of a space expedition designed to both explore other worlds and revive the culture of a dying warrior society.Agar\'s ship attempts to rescue a sister ship that crash landed on a distant planet.  Eighteen years of real time have passed since the crash, or is it 18 years of my life that have been lost watching this movie?  Anyhow, Linda, the only woman on this ""prehistoric"" planet is the one brought there by Corey, whom it turns out is the love child of Corey and a woman from the Centaurian society that he\'s trying to save.  Linda meets up with Tang (breakfast drink or hunter-gatherer, you decide), who is the offspring of two of the crash\'s survivors.The movie\'s ending leaves you groaning under the weight of the true premise of Tang & Linda existence on this planet.  This premise comes from a decidedly non-Christian world view.  Watch this if you are an MST3K fan; otherwise, skip this primordial soup starter.', ""A spaceship under the commander of Wendell Corey goes to explore a planet where a colony was abandoned. Because of time diliation -- which is sorta explained in the dialogue, but not in any way that makes sense -- more time has passed on the planet than in the ship, leading to the people on the planet having been there for a couple of generations, and subsided into wearing furs and leather and stuff. Corey's crew, which includes John Agar, find one (1) prehistoric woman, who falls in love with Robert Ito.Making extensive use of sets, library clips of iguanas, the music of Gordon Kahler, and the camerawork of Archie Dalzell, this dull little epic has no redeeming qualities."", 'There is only one way to watch this film...and that is with witty commentary.', ""We just watched this on Mystery Science theatre 3000 and there were absolutely NO prehistoric women. I don't know every thing edited out as I'd not seen the original version. But this version had more holes in it than you could count. Since it was on-demand you'd assume you'd get the whole thing. No prehistoric women, no fights with prehistoric people, original lost crew found but no explanation of why their condition was the way it was. Truly a Weird Cut."", ""Wow.  A very cheesy space flick with corny humor to boot.Apparently, Centaurions aren't feeling good about being mistreated, there's a mutiny, nice model ship crash and the film mixes into a caveman/futuristic/love story.  I was hoping for Wendell Corey's demise, but it doesn't happen (rats).  The hotty Linda meets a guy named Tang.  That's mostly all I can recall or all I want to.  Do not reveal the ending of Biblical proportions!Loved the space age weapons...I think they were 38 calibers.  What a vision to see a future with no lasers or disintegrators!"", 'The title of this film suggests a space expedition of a bunch of men who are lonely finding a planet full of buxom beauties and is typically the type of film one tends to find on late at night on Cinemax. I think there are a couple of films that have titles similar to this one that do pretty much follow that formula. This one, however, is nothing like that and instead is a rather strange film where there are no women on any prehistoric planet. There is a prehistoric planet though, so that portion of the title at least is not misleading. I saw this film as an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, and while not entirely bad, it is kind of a silly movie featuring John Agar who would go on to star in a few more movies riffed by the gang on the satellite of love. It would also feature Wendell Corey who was also in another film they riffed, Agent for H.A.R.M. The film does do a somewhat good job of creating another world, however, like most science fiction films of the era, the prehistoric wildlife consists of a lizard being projected to look big, your typical boa constrictor snake and a plush toy spider. Still, considering what they had to work with back then, they did okay.The story has a ship being hijacked by a race of people called Centurions. By hijacking the ship, they cause it to crash on a mysterious and unexplored planet. Another ship goes to the rescue, but due to the fact their ship is traveling at the speed of light, by the time they reach the planet 18 years has passed by, while the people on the rescue ship have not aged at all. A team goes out to explore the planet and find the wreckage of the ship in the slim hopes there were survivors; however, Linda, who is also a Centurion yearns to breath in the fresh air and goes exploring the planet herself and meets up with a young man named Tang whose parents were part of the crew that crashed. A romance blossoms even as the rescue team begins to crumble under the stress and the captain must decide how to go about finding Linda and getting them off the prehistoric planet.This movie was featured on the first season of MST3K, so the riffs are okay, but at this point they had not hit their stride yet. Servo was still being voiced by the one guy who just did not nail the riffs nearly as good as Kevin Murphy would do from the second season till shows initial end. Like I said, it was okay, but the movie actually carried this one as it was not too terribly bad. The film might have actually been good if not for the horrific comic relief guy and the guy from ""Agent From H.A.R.M"" who like in that film seems inebriated and slurs most of his lines. Then there are points that are just ridiculous where the rescue team crosses a log over an acidic pond when you can see a perfectly good land bridge only five feet from the log. Of course, that made for one of the better riffs and laughs as well as the plush toy spider attack! So, the film had some good points, had this one been made later it would have probably been a fairly decent soft core adult film. Heck, the way the film plays out, add a couple of more females and it could have made a good hardcore too as the plot really does seem to suggest some of the crew are getting randy. However, during the time it was made, we have to have very short peeks and use are imagination and that does not really carry the day. More wildlife attacks could have helped this one as well as no horrible comic relief guy or actor who apparently had one hell of a drinking problem. Still, as far as science fiction films of the 60\'s, it was pretty typical.', '1965\'s ""Women of the Prehistoric Planet"" formed a double bill with ""The Navy vs. the Night Monsters,"" a last gasp theatrical revival for Jack Broder\'s Realart Pictures, sitting on the shelf for over a year prior to release, then quickly sold to television after a lukewarm box office response. Producer George Edwards was involved in both, coming off double duty for director Curtis Harrington on ""Queen of Blood"" and ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet,"" hardly venturing far with this similarly titled item announced as ""Prehistoric Planet Women,"" screenwriter Arthur C. Pierce at the helm to direct his own script for the only time in his sci fi career. The 11 day shooting schedule finished in June 1965, its threadbare sets and pitiful effects allowing very little in the way of acting from a cast comprised of veterans like John Agar, Wendell Corey, Keith Larsen, and Glenn Langan, with up and comers like Robert Ito (KUNG FU, QUINCY), Stuart Margolin (THE ROCKFORD FILES), Adam Roarke (Ray Milland\'s ""Frogs""), and Paul Hampton (David Cronenberg\'s ""Shivers""). Worst of all is the misleading title and ad campaign, promising girl fights and giant creatures, offering one rather civilized cave man briefly battling a few savage primitives, a giant lizard that gets roasted in five seconds, and a ludicrous puppet tarantula that lunches on Stuart Margolin\'s back. The opening credits unspool to the theme from ""Creature from the Black Lagoon,"" Wendell Corey top billed as Admiral King, returning to Earth with two fellow ships trailing behind, forced to locate the one that has crashlanded on the aforementioned planet called Solarius, where the last survivor is a female Centaurian (most of whom are played by Asians) who gives birth to Robert Ito\'s Tang, the titular prehistoric caveman grown to full adulthood by the time King\'s Cosmos arrives at the speed of light (space time continuum is something that STAR TREK would pick up on). Various crew members go out for one reason or another, beautiful Irene Tsu as Centaurian Linda naturally enjoying a nude swim before being menaced by an ordinary boa constrictor, rescued from near drowning by the alert Tang. Love at first sight is sadly unavoidable in a 90 minute feature, lesser characters biting the dust yet comic relief Paul Gilbert criminally surviving to improvise much of his unfunny schtick. Director Arthur C. Pierce isn\'t able to overcome the crippling budget with any visual interest but his script does deliver a few ideas that most cheap sci fi items don\'t bother to examine, just try to forget that twist during the last 20 seconds, perhaps the funniest gag of all.', ""And it's a real pity that it was in the first national, Comedy Channel (pre-Comedy Central) season of MST3K (before Josh Weinstein left to work on THE SIMPSONS, and before Mike Nelson signed on as a utility actor), so it presumably won't be reissued on home video in their version, while my off-cable VHS tape is on its last legs. The cast makes the film, as several have noted here, as does the twist ending you know M. Shyamalan is waiting to spring on us again any film now...I won't reveal it, but its probably the oldest cliché in bad written SF, so ridiculously hack that even the usually shameless film industry hasn't bothered with it much over the decades.However, quite aside from seeing Stuart Margolin beginning his long, deft, typecast career, and Robert Ito with surely no inkling of his similarly long television career to come, for this viewer, the female cast, led in this regard by Irene Tsu and Merry Anders, is remarkably lovely. Arthur C. Pierce, truly an undersung contributor to the Whacked tradition of film-making, provided us with so much in his few mid-'60s features. It's a pity we haven't given him more attention...or, perhaps, not. But these are wonderfully weird (not least in their utter lack of realization of how schlock they are), and often hard to find, films."", ""I watched this movie on a Monday night cuz nothing was on. In fact, I bought this movie. It's actually really good. It's about these astronauts who travel through space and the time shifting is off from real time. The main guys are kind of like scientists and there are a few women on this ship also. They are going to a planet that has dinosaurs and lakes made of acid. Very strange huh? Well some cavemen eventually torment the folks on this planet and there is an engineer who is really into doing stand up comedy in the middle of an expedition. He just talks and talks and at one point he does a FLIP for no reason. There is a Chinese man named TANG who is like ADAM and a woman named LINDA who is like Eve. As the astronauts leave, they look behind at the planet and name it Earth. It was a goosebump moment for sure!""]",13,['Science Fiction']

This movie is L-A-M-E lame. It\'s packed with all sorts of awful dialogue, poor performances, racial stereotypes (including the big fat black woman who waves her finger at everyone and finishes every sentence with the word ""girlfriend"") and so on and so forth.Nowadays it\'s best remembered for starring Jada Pinkett (Smith), wife of Will Smith. Her performance isn\'t that good and it\'s hard to believe they based an entire movie -- including the TITLE! -- on her character.Overall this is poor, stupid, (intellectually) offensive and insulting, clichéd, stereotypical and worse than all that: uninteresting!

Right away you realise that this isn't a groundbreaking sex comedy and perhaps needed something to set it apart from other movies in the sub genre and there's nothing here that does But what really ruins the film is the ethnic stereotypes and I don't think I've seen so many unlikely characters since watching black exploitation movies like SHAFT and Hit-man . The audience are really smacked over the head as to just how funky these black people are which will probably cause offence to black people and white liberals and will certainly irritate everyone else , so from having a movie that from the outset would merely have been very run of the mill we have a movie that is embarrassing . If you're going to populate a film with black people at least give them non stereotypical quirks"", ""I should have known that this film wasn't going to be any good; the director made another film by the name of 'The Guru' which has the 'honour' of being the only film that I've ever rated lower than 4/10(!) The thing is with this film is that most of the time, you're laughing at it, instead of with it. Some typical examples of this are occurrences when the main character's friends, or indeed, any characters for that matter, talk in the way that they do. You'll instantly recognise the style; the typical 'gangster' accent which is actually more amusing than a lot of the jokes. Given the fact this film is made up of an entirely black cast, this method of delivering the dialogue is constant throughout and is, in my opinion, very annoying after a while. It's not 'Chris Tucker' annoying but it grates in its own way.This film's setting takes a bit of a 'road movie' approach as it never lingers for too long in a certain place or setting, or at least that's how these single route journey's in film SHOULD take place. In 'Woo', the place of no return they set off from (the guy's apartment) right the way through to the final scene is crammed with ridiculous scenes in pretty generic settings and the frustrating thing is, is that they last for far too long and are far too unfunny to be appearing in a film which is listed under the comedy genre.Incidences here include the farce that happens in an Italian restaurant, a rather pointless and unfunny scene in the next setting: a secret underground club which has the ability to hide its loud music RIGHT until you get up close and open the final door and also in a police station during which I can't even remember one joke. Other frustrating things include the use of slapstick early on and a rather irrelevant scene involving LL Cool J, whom the protagonist goes to visit for advice on: wait for it\x85..music(!) I think LL Cool J appears rather early/high up in the pre film credits yet lasts for about four minutes. Yes, it's ridiculous.Romance? Yes. Drama? Probably. Comedy? Erm: No Chance. One moment in this film made me laugh and that was when a character went to switch off his car alarm, only to find the car gone and the alarm lying there, still in perfect working order. That's not enough, I'm afraid."", '""Woo"" has a fine cast.  Jada Pinkett has great charisma.  Tommy Davidson is a fine comic actor, though he isn\'t too convincing as a straight-arrow law student.  The film is written in sitcom format.  The film consists of one implausible scene of conflict after another (especially at the Italian restaurant), desperate to find a punchline.  Some of the scenes work.  I thought the scene at the transvestite bar was hilarious.  And I liked the little cameo by Billy Dee.  That gave the film a touch of class.  It\'s too bad LL Cool J only had one scene.  I liked his smooth ""mack daddy"" character.  But with a film like this, even though it\'s a comedy, your disbelief elevates by the minute and it just doesn\'t have a natural, character-driven flow.  It forces itself upon the audience.  And the third act is predictable and unconvincing.  This is a film that could\'ve been more than OK, if it had a little more wit and focus.  If this is about a 1 or 2 dollar rental at your local video store--this is not a bad film to rent. Otherwise, I wouldn\'t recommend this one.', ""Woo was released in May of 1998, near the end after Titanic hit it's stride of making more than a billion dollars worldwide at the box office and winning the top Academy Awards of that year. Well 1998 was a memorable year for me, and Woo was apart of it. Woo was far from earning any of the money and awards Titanic did, but it also had major competition of other block busters such as Godzilla.To digress, I saw Woo back in theaters then and thought it was a reasonable romantic comedy. Jada Pinkett Smith was good as the sassy and sexy party girl who tries to seduce and date a straighted headed young lawyer (Tommy Davidson). I later re-discovered Woo on video a few years later and realized that it was indeed quite a dull comedy with little laughs, but the talent and directing and plot sorta kept it going. With Duane Martin and cameos by LL Cool J, Woo was nothing too special but at least viewed for the fans of Tommy Davidson and Jada Pinkett Smith.On another note, Woo does have a good rather hip rap song 'Nobody Does it Better' performed by Warren G and Nate Dogg. Awesome song."", ""Had some laughs but it's a movie we've seen many times. Jada Pinckett is hot. Tommy Davidson is goofy. It's a one time watch for me. Check it out but don't pay to watch it.

The scence with the She males was just plain hilarious!!!! Moreover, the park scene had some funny lines. Romaine\'s ""Damn baby let me suck the left one and make the right one jealous"", had me rolling on the floor. Dave Chappelle and LL Cool J had limited participation, but brought good aspects to the film. Overall, there have been some horrible films produced by Hollywood, this wasn\'t one of them.

Tommy Davidson, not the funniest person I\'ve seen on the screen didn\'t do that bad of a job.', 'Not all movies are made to answer some of life\'s most puzzling questions.

All my favorite comedy actors are here: Jada of course (looking as lovely as I\'ve ever seen her), Dave Chapelle, Duane Martin, Paula Jai Parker, Aida Turturro, LL Cool J and Dartanyan Edmonds. Even Foxy Brown makes an appearance and it\'s not too bad either.Overall, it is funny. Everyone has experienced the ""blind date"" syndrome and this movie takes it to another level. Lynne with the wine and fried chicken was funny, Tommies 3 friends in the gay club was classic, and everything that could go wrong for Tommie goes wrong. Jada was very sexy, smart, and in control. Something a lot of men may not enjoy watching. And who could hate a movie with the great Billy Dee Williams making a cameo appearance? Many people hated this movie and I can not see why unless your expectations were to high to begin with. Just relax, watch it, laugh, reflect, and have a good evening.

It soon becomes apparent that help is not coming and he has to get out of the car. But once he\'s free, his troubles have only just begun, as he finds out that he is not alone in the woods.There is a lot to like about this little film. Adrien Brody does a great job of displaying how painful and lonely it would be if one was trapped in this particular situation, and of course the film rests on his acting and the great imagery and camera work. The film never becomes too slow, and there is always a new little plot point or clue that leads the viewer on. Of course one should not go into this film expecting a sordid tale of survival and battles with mountain lions. Instead, what we have is a psychological exploration, where the woods serve as the back drop for all of the character\'s guilts and desires, and soon we are doubting what is real and what isn\'t. Think of J.G. Ballard\'s ""Concrete Island"" or Stephen King\'s ""Gerald\'s Game"". While it is ultimately weak with a so-so story, ""Wrecked"" is worth watching at least once just to enjoy the work of Brody and the fluid flow of the film.', ""Right. First of all I need to express my disappointment. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie for quite some time now. Ever since I saw the trailer, from which it looked really attractive. It looked like it was going to be an interesting, psychedelic story, with twists and tension. ESPECIALLY due to the fact that ADRIEN BRODY is there! Because after seeing ''The Jacket'', in which Adrien Brody also starred, I was left stunned. So you can imagine the gripping excitement that came to me about half a year ago before the release of ''Wrecked'' when I found out that a movie like this would come out! But everyone, who has high hopes for this film because of the same, or at least a similar reason, can give up right now. This movie will definitely NOT satisfy, let alone EXCEEED, your expectations, because...well...It is boring. Simple as that. The plot itself is really plain. So plain, that it would actually be difficult to spoil anything, since there is almost nothing to spoil. The trailer alone can give out practically everything. And the film is really TOO LONG. And that makes this dull plot even MORE painfully tiresome. If they would have reduced the whole movie to about 30 minutes, I am sure it would have turned out to an interesting short, but now, harshly speaking, it looks like a bad version of ''127 hours''. This movie practically tells nothing new or interesting to the audience. But there is one reason to not completely condemn this title. Adrien Brody. Even thought, the story is disappointing, I cannot complain in any way about the amazing performance by Adrien Brody. Flawless acting. But that's it. Nothing more essentially positive that I can think of that was good in this movie... The make-up on Adrien Brody maybe?... If you have a significantly huge amount of unbendable patience within you, you may actually get lucky and think it was an OK movie. Otherwise, which is a lot more likely, you WILL not be impressed. At all."", ""This is going to be a very short review because, frankly, there isn't much to say about Wrecked. The first 20 to 30 minutes of the film consists of Adrien Brody trapped in a wrecked car deep in the forest\x85 For the remaining 65 minutes, we get to see Brody crawling around the forest / wilderness. Throw in a hallucination here and a mountain lion there, and that's the whole film. Not too entertaining, even with the few appearances of the mountain lion – and that says a lot about the approach director Michael Greenspan took with the film. Despite Adrien being a great actor and doing his absolute best with the script, the film never really delivers on the suspense or the thrills. It's a one-man show that goes absolutely nowhere, and that's not Brody's fault. Greenspan never picks up the pace of the film; he uses flashbacks and hallucinations ineffectively; and tries to build suspense around a story-line that just doesn't have any. If you want to see a great survival film with few characters that gets it right, watch Frozen, 127 Hours with James Franco, or the classic Cast Away with Tom Hanks."", 'Imagine for a minute that you wake up bludgeoned, battered, bloody and bruised pinned in a steel death trap at the base of a mountain with no recollection of how or why you are there, with the only sign of humanity being an unknown corpse in the back seat. This ""in medias res"" beginning is how Director Michael Greenspan and Writer Christopher Dodd start off their debut feature film titled Wrecked.Wrecked is a story of a man (played by Adrian Brody) that has just awoken in the after math of a major car accident in what appears to be a ravine with only a corpse (and his deteriorating mind) to accompanying him. After a days worth of struggle Brody finally frees himself from the constraints of the wreckage only to crawl through hellacious terrain while trying to ward off haunting hallucinations that have manifested from guilt of an incident he can\'t even remember.Brody\'s performance is nothing short of spectacular especially considering the sheer screen time and lack of dialogue he has in the film, however this didn\'t stop him from portraying an ineffable range of emotion throughout. Brody isn\'t the only star on deck however, Cinematographer James Liston emphasizes this by employing juxtaposed high and low angle shot\'s to help shroud Brody\'s already enigmatic mind. The story however seem to have a couple ""hiccups"" that take away from the overall verisimilitude of the film which can be a deal breaker for some. This should not deter anyone from the film, it is well worth the time.', '127 Hours [2010] and Wrecked [2011] contain similar plots and big name actors (James Franco and Adrien Brody). They are set in a minimal location with a suffocating feel. One is based on a true story; the other is fiction. During the long middle stretch of movie, 127 Hours substitutes emotional highs and lows in the score instead of conflict/action, which Wrecked does a much better job at. A raw comparison of the plots gives 127 Hours a harsh reality, while Wrecked puts us inside Brody\'s mind of amnesia and hallucination. They end the same, but with a little help from Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Ros, 127 Hours manages to finish on a higher note. One was nominated for best picture, and one gets a shoddy rating on IMDb.I do not believe the term, ""Based on a true story,"" can cover up moments of less perfection. True stories are not commercial box office hits. That\'s how ""based on a true story"" came to be, to fantasize and fictionalize the true story into film mythology. The writer\'s job is to make a story\'s conflict much like a concert. If a story contains all truth and is boring, there should be rewrites until we are moved, with bits of conflict that can sensationalize the boring truth.For this reason, where 127 Hours lags, Wrecked excels, and where 127 Hours must stick to a certain blue print, Wrecked can explore the mind of the protagonist in great depth. Plan on seeing an underrated, captivating, Adrien Brody indie in 2011.', ""For you never know what is going to happen. I haven't heard anything about this movie and went to IMDb to check out the reviews about it prior to watching it. Considering them exceedingly bad, I decided to check it out anyway, to make my own mind. Well, I have a few things to say. It is a slow movie. I understand some viewers might find it annoying. BUT If you read the Trivias about this flick, you will learn it has been written without knowing where it was going.Without being aware of that I too found this movie exceedingly boring, because it lacks proper timing for twists or actions in a way. Knowing that, and if you're not afraid of independent (even experimental) movies, you can go on and you might enjoy it.If you are a fan of Adrien Brody, you should probably watch this movie as well, because he really fits well in the part of a man knowing as much as the viewer do as the movie begins, sadly he has to fight until the end, and so does the viewer who thought he was in for a special thriller and survival movie like Cast Away and/or 127 hours. You have to be aware that even though it's quite close to those films due to the subject, you cannot compare at all, for this is, I repeat, a whole experience considering the non- conventional way of writing.All that to say, if you're looking for some strong thrills watching a man struggling for his own survival, you should probably stick to Cast Away & 127 hours.On the other hand, if you're willing to witness another type of setting for a man trying to figure out what he is doing here and why, a low budget movie exploring the nothingness as the new standard for making a story, then Wrecked is a movie to watch. Thanks to Adrien Brody's performance, and the nature of the experimental writing process revealed, this movie deserves a 6 out of 10."", ""This is a very uncomfortable film. Now I don't mean it is bad. I mean this is the type of film you can feel and you start to feel what the main character is going through. The whole movie is based around one main character played by Adrien Brody. He did an excellent job. The movie starts with him waking up in a car that had fallen off a small cliff. He is alive, but the people around him are dead. Through the whole film you are trying to piece together what happened. By the end you figure it out, but there are some things they leave untouched on purpose. Let the viewers mind come up with its own conclusions. This movie takes on a different type of scary. Like a real life scary. I remember a few scenes that when they happened, I couldn't help but shake my head and think much that would really suck in real life. The writers of the film made a good story and the director did a good job with little budget they probably had. This was a very nice suspenseful film."", ""I read a few of the reviews on here about this movie, and they gave the impression that this movie left too many unanswered questions and the ending was not satisfying. I don't know what questions these reviews were referring to, but for me the ending was pretty much self explanatory.The acting was brilliant, the direction, the location and scenes were all done really well. The story was adequately thought provoking too.To sum it up, the movie felt like an experience, not just a visual entertainment. 7 out of 10 for me!Having said that it's not a movie for everyone, if you like movies where you can feel the character's environment then you'll like this, but if you prefer lots of dialogues, lots of people and lots of action then you probably wanna watch something else.""]",9,"['Thriller', 'Mystery']"

The acting is not amazing, (except for Viva Bianca who probably the only thing that made this whole movie worthwhile) you don't understand why the characters behave the way they do.

They manage to keep you interested and hooked because you're hoping somehow everything will fit into order eventually. NOT.

This movie reminds me of Dane Giraud\'s ""Luella Miller from 2005 in a way.There are probably many others who disagree with me but in my view,this film is not even worth the rental time.There are so many other good movies in this category.I can mention Djo Munga\'s Viva Riva,Phillip Noyce\'s Dead Calm and Giuseppe Tornatore\'s The Unknown Woman(La Sconosciuta).', 'The Plot: Holly Rowe\'s retiring, kissing her callgirl life goodbye. She just has to get through her last night on the job. Shay Ryan\'s a teenage runaway, broke and alone. She just has to get through her first night as a hooker. Then fate throws them together on a job that goes horribly wrong and they\'re trapped on an out-of-control roller coaster ride, through the twilight zone of sex-for-sale. X is a sizzling adults-only thriller about love, chance, escape and the oldest profession experienced by two women, on a night that will change their lives forever.This movie is silly. It\'s directed like one of those horrible sex flicks on cable TV late at night. Also, it\'s not called X in the titles. The titles use the name ""EXIT"" as the title of the film. I guess they thought it was more titillating to call it X...About the only thing I enjoyed was seeing the scenes of Sydney. Haven\'t been there in a long time....funny tho...I DO remember the hookers, but they were all trannies!!In the end, there\'s nothing thrilling about this film. It\'s rather slow and boring to be frank.', 'X paints itself off, as something better that it is. I must admit, I was disappointed some, in this. After lasting one week on the cinema circuit in Adelaide, it\'s easy to see why. It\'s just a weak drama. It does has a tragic end though for one of it\'s characters, who I never thought would bite the bullet. Here\'s the plot of the movie, mostly set over one night in that lurid sewer, King\'s Cross. An upper class call girl (they all are- Viva Bianca) who caters to some quite elite sorts, is getting out of the business and Sydney. Her and this guy, do a real sexy R rated strip dance, before a group of middle aged, refined sorts (what weirdos). It\'s quite amusing in bits too. Bianca hasn\'t told her client/boyfriend.... wait for it.... cop (Peter Docker) yet, she\'s getting out. Of course. But feeling guilty and obligated, she does, over dinner, at the advice of her tranny friend. Not a good idea. Now more characters come into play, one another pro friend of Bianca\'s who dies in a showering freak accident, you could say. Fresh off the bus, in King\'s Cross, is a seventeen year old runaway (Hanna Mangan Lawrence). She\'s befriended by an even younger street smart girl, a sly little devil, who gives her some pointers about the seedy cross streets. In the hours that ensue, she\'s beaten up and robbed, for intruding on other pro\'s turf. She causes a vehiclist, a scummy looking client, while induced in a bit of role playing, being fondled by Hanna\'s stroking, loving hand, to go arse up another car of three tall hoons. They are not happy chappies. Luck comes her way in the form of Bianca, who throws her an offer that turns out to be a fatal acceptance, where later on, it becomes hell night. Watching Lawrence boozed up, and nude, doing some drunken dancing for a client, a 20\'s Lebanese guy, she shares with Bianca, was one of the better rewards of the film. There were small moments of hotness there. Only the two, are witness to this Leb\'s murder, by some hit men, where now they\'re both pursued, and are soon split up again. Mostly to blame here is the selfish Bianca. Lawrence returns to the Cross and holds out in a run down junkie motel, where she gets to hang out with some lowlife types. Oh I forgot to mention, she\'s befriended by a taxi driver, who slowly tries to coax her into a relationship. I mean this guy, also seen in Careless love, would have to be 28+. She tells him ""It wouldn\'t work out. Everyone I get close to, gets hurt"". Puzzle that over. Gentleman that he is, he does shout her a delicious chilli dog and coke from Cafe de Wheel\'s. The movie gets more intense near the end. This movie is very predictable, as it\'s stereotypical of so many other movies. One could say it\'s old hat. Had X been made twenty five years before, when it should of, it would of come out with much more dignity. As such, now, it just comes off as a wishy washy, forgettable drama, despite a great performance from Bianca, and the sexy presence of Mangan Lawrence. The last scene though, stays with me, between the cabbie and Lawrence, when looking out over the ocean. It\'s Lawrence\'s last line, a chilling admittance, that does make sense, when you ponder the history of so many runaways from broken homes. The actress who plays the trannie, who so reminds me of the woman from The Jammed, co wrote this, not the only star featured here, from the much better Redball.', 'This movie has a seedy feel to it - one could even call it ""sleazy."" That, however, isn\'t a criticism. It\'s quite appropriate actually, and it was clearly the feel that director Jon Hewitt needed to establish. The subject matter really left very little choice. How else could it feel?It\'s the story of two prostitutes who ply their trade in Sydney, Australia - one a veteran in the business who\'s ready to get out of it, and the other a younger girl just getting into the business. Both Viva Bianca (as Holly, the veteran) and Hanna Mangan Lawrence (as Shay, the rookie) played their parts well. Holly and Shay meet up on a ""job,"" and while in their customers\' apartment, hidden away in the bathroom when he gets an unexpected visit from a ""business associate,"" they witness his murder. When the murderer (played by Stephen Bennett) realizes that he\'s been seen, he sets out to get Holly and Shay, and the movie turns into a fairly standard ""chase"" sort of movie, through Sydney\'s less desirable neighbourhoods I would say. There\'s an attempted twist around the identity of the murderer that didn\'t really catch me off guard. I hadn\'t thought about it, but it didn\'t come as a surprise when we found out who he was.""X"" features a lot of nudity, and some scenes of sexuality (again, what you would expect given the subject matter) and it\'s also at times rather violent - again, not a surprise. In many ways it\'s decent enough. Nothing special, but enough to keep you watching. The biggest weakness to the story, to me at least, revolved around the character of Harry, the taxi driver. He and Shay fall for each other during a taxi ride (yes, he got to catch her topless in the mirror, and that was enough to make him fall madly in love apparently!) His part in the story seemed completely unnecessary and totally unbelievable. I guess he serves to point out that Shay is torn between her perceived need to prostitute herself to survive, and her desire for a normal life with a nice guy. But their relationship just didn\'t come across as credible to me, and it really did weaken the whole story. (4/10)', ""Retiring call girl Holly (Viva Bianca) has to get through one last night on the job. Another girl who was supposed to join her for a threesome with a client is a no-show, so she has to find a replacement. Enter Shay (Hanna Mangan Lawrence), a runaway teenager on her first night as a prostitute. Holly picks her up and takes her to the job. But things go horribly wrong and soon the girls are running for their lives.This was an OK movie, if somewhat predictable. I would never have tried it if it didn't star the lovely and talented Viva Bianca. She's quite good in it. So is Hanna Lawrence. There is a sense of familiarity over the plot. Also, lots of contrived things happen in order to ramp up suspense. That might irritate some viewers. Ultimately, it's a watchable thriller with some sexy parts. Viva Bianca fans will definitely want to check it out."", ""If your foray into Australian dramas is Neighbours or Home and away or film production is limited to Crocodile Dundee then this gritty, erotic thriller set in the seedy part of Sydney will blow your preconceptions away.Holly (Viva Bianca) is a veteran high class call girl on her last night before moving to Paris. Shay (Hanna Mangan-Lawrence) is a runaway to Sydney and its her first night on the streets. She already has been involved in a road accident while performing a trick on a client and beaten up by a rival hooker's pimp.Holly recruits Shay for a threesome with a client in a hotel room but they end up witnessing a killing and end up being on the run as the killer pursues them and he is not man who is prepared to stay down even if he is run over by a car.This is a low budget urban thriller in the seamy side of life. It starts of as erotica where we see Holly having sex with a naked man in a room full of women and the director makes sure that there is regular female nudity as the film goes along.The film may not have too much of a plot and I guess with a director like Paul Verhoeven and a bigger budget this film would be an intriguing erotic thriller but its good to see a grittier side of Australian cinema."", ""I watched this film with a view to seeing two actresses work together in a project different from that which I had already enjoyed. Viva Bianca and Hannah Mangan-Lawrence gave great performances, and I enjoyed the depth they gave their characters, which I'm sure had little to do with the writing.This film is one reaction after another, the poor girls never had a chance to collect themselves and make an impact on the story, they were just caught up in an unravelling mess of a situation.There was one occasion when the girls seemed ahead of the curve, but that quickly turned into a fist fight that only gave them something else to react to rather than thickening the plot.I know that reactive stories are not something I like, it was the same problem I had with The Incredible Hulk. And yet I don't feel I can knock the film for it because the tag-line states that this film is about 2 women and 1 bad night. And that it is."", ""X is an Australian film about two prostitutes who witness a drug deal gone wrong. It was an okay movie, not amazing, but definitely not the worst I've ever watched. It had a somewhat predictable storyline, it didn't seem that well written to be honest. It was one of those movies where at the end you sort of feel slightly empty and leaves you questioning, was that it? I'd recommend this movie as a last resort if you have nothing else to watch, I certainly wouldn't be going out of your way to view it as you really will not be missing out on much at all. All in all I give it a 5 out of 10 and I think that is being generous."", ""Do not watch this because of the cover. Or rather tone down the expectations you might have seeing that cover. You will be expecting more than you will actually get. Not that there isn't anything to see (that will remind you of that cover), but this is a thriller at heart and you should be looking forward to that aspect of the movie more than anything else.The actors in this are good enough, the story is trivial, but not anything that will drag you down or make you feel too bad/uncomfortable watching.

I really wanted to like this movie, as I do have an interest in Hayley Kiyoko and Sarah Hyland, and because I love other movies with similar aesthetics (Spring Breakers, for example) but I guess they could only work with what they had. I don\'t understand why either of them would stoop to this level of garbage, but sure enough they did. Money is more important than substance.The writing. The writing is so god awful that it\'s almost painful to watch it play out on- screen. The acting was obviously not top-notch but I blame that mostly on the terrible script itself. The characters were stereotypical and had very little redeeming qualities, not to mention they were so thinly written that you could care less about what happens to any of them. The story itself was also bad; nothing that exciting happened throughout the entire film and there were so many moments that randomly turned into an entirely aesthetic-fueled music video. In addition, the script seemed to find it very difficult to find any balance between negative and positive exploitation of the EDM festival scene. I constantly kept asking myself, ""Is this trying to mock festival goers or is it trying to embrace them?""The only redeeming qualities about this movie was the music (as an EDM fan, I did appreciate the soundtrack choices). The only other thing I would say was moderately decent was the visuals. Many of the visuals were well-done while some were very cheesy, so it was a mixed bag in that department. I was looking forward to this movie and was extremely disappointed because they could have done so much more with the story. Overall, I would not recommend this movie unless you simply want to watch it for the aesthetics, visuals and music. Do NOT expect a good story going into it and you may end up liking it more than I did.', ""XOXO tells stories about six different people that revolved around an electronic dance music festival. A young DJ, a manager, a hopeless romantic girl, an apathetic man, and a struggling couple. Their paths will collide and somehow, the music festival will brought out their worst and their best.Plot-wise, this movie is really generic. None of the twists and resolutions are shocking nor original. The same can be say for the characters, as they were taken out of boring overdone tropes that previous movies has. The actors did an okay job, with Brett DelBuono rises among the rest. Sarah Hyland could be much better, given her Modern Family roots.The visuals in this movie however, are appealing and engaging. Although there are no jaw dropping shots, this movie managed to capture the festival's spirit (which basically just a lot of people taking drugs and jump around til they're tired) just right.If you like EDM and are looking for visual references, go ahead and watch.

Since turning 18, I've had my far share of raves, and while watching XOXO, it made me want to get off my feet, go party, and have a good time.

Two characters specifically, the boyfriend and girlfriend, I felt could've been cut from the film entirely. They really didn't have much to do with the plot as a whole, and the creators could've used that to build more on the more centralized plot. The film had great acting and a good idea, but I personally felt that there could've been more. 5/10"", 'Dance music is kind of difficult to capture in film.

The story is corny and filled with clichés, the writing is terrible, it is melodramatic, boring and completely uninspiring. I expected much more from a film starring Madhuri Dixit, Ajay Devgan and Preity Zinta. The film starts with the characters of Ajay and Preity, two professional thieves who perform planned robberies. The character of Ajay appears to be Madhuri Dixit\'s character\'s deceased husband\'s lookalike and there starts the trouble when he enters her house on the day of his death. Yeh, complicated and messy it is. The film\'s saving grace may be Madhuri Dixit who delivers a sincere and natural performance. Ajay Devgan is completely unimpressive here, so is Preity Zinta, who is just okay and whose charm and vivaciousness seem to be missing in this act. Perhaps the most watchable sequence in the entire movie is the song ""Jo Pyaar Karta Hai"". It is a beautiful and moving song and the acting of the actors on-screen while they are singing it is convincing, particularly the contradicting moods of Zinta and Dixit, the former having sad and poignant expressions and the latter being happy and joyful.

Yes Man,3.76,4.52,['Comedy'],"A man challenges himself to say ""yes"" to everything.",anticipation,"['...you\'re under the age of 25 and uninventive comedy and PG-13 crude sexual humor is what makes you laugh.Seriously, how did this movie rate a ""7.0"" on IMDb?? Maybe they should start requiring an age and/or IQ factor to help normalize the final user ratings for movies...Granted, there was the basic premise of an interesting idea in this movie, but there was so much lameness in so much of the movie that it was just basically (to me) unfunny. Then again, if you just get into stupid mindless gag-type comedy and rather tasteless crude sexual humor, then maybe it might rate a 7.0 or greater for you.There were a few clever as well as a few sweet moments in the movie (i.e., respectively, when Carrey\'s various ""Yes!""-inspired self-improvement forays come in handy in unexpected ways, and scenes with Zooey\'s big hound dog eyes doing their best emotive magic), but very few.What a shame, and what a waste of Carrey\'s comedic talents. Sure, he\'s been a big commercial success the last 10-15 years, but you would have to be older than 25 to really remember and appreciate how truly comically inventive and talented he was as he became a surprise star in the Wayans Brothers\' show ""In Living Color"" on the then-fledgling Fox Network.As for ""Yes Man,"" my advice is to just say ""No"" if you\'re over 25 or 30.', 'Having just seen this, I can say that this is Jim Carrey at his worst. How he sank to such a low level is beyond me. ""Copper Mountain"" looks like a masterpiece compared to this travesty of a film.I was lucky I got to see this film for free. I was actually dragged along to it by a friend of mine after he scored some free tickets. I really had no intention of seeing it. I kept thinking, what can possibly be fun about a guy who says ""YES"" to everything for a whole year? My suspicions came true at the conclusion of the film. It is obvious that Carrey is struggling in his career (he hasn\'t had a solid hit for quite some time) and to me, it seems that he sincerely felt that this film would lift him out of ""Washed Up Beach"". I will admit, there was a few funny lines and moments in this film, but they are few and far between.As per usual, Carrey uses his rubber-face and physical comedy for laughs, but it has just the opposite effect. It\'s sad to see a man pushing 50 prancing around with a big grin slapped on his face.Wait for the DVD - or better yet, wait until it\'s screened on TV.', 'Yes Man was a delight to watch. Critics had panned it a bit, but unfairly, in my view. Granted, it is formulaic, but it IS a rom-com, and rom-coms have formulas. What made this film so great was the natural charm of Zooey Deschanel. She is beautiful, of course, but not in a ""model-y"" kind of way. She has always had a freshness and honesty about her that makes her appealing. When I first saw her in ""Almost Famous,"" playing the older sister, I wished I had an older sister like that. When she played the girl lead in Big Trouble, she was quirky, but without any of the self-aware conceit that can often accompany quirky young female actors. I will be kind and avoid names, but perhaps you can picture in your mind some of the ""Tragically Hip"" and oh-so-cool young actresses who do quirk with a smirk. Zooey Deschanel has an innocence and a friendly quality that really make her shine, in the way a flower shines.Jim Carrey was also very good in this. He is who he is--- goofy and loopy and elastic. This wasn\'t a ""Serious Role,"" such as Truman Show serious--- but wasn\'t over the top like Ace Ventura. Maybe he\'s mellowed with age. I liked him as a wild kid, but like him even more now that he is a bit ""evened out."" He is still hilarious--- but also a bit more human, and a bit more approachable.This movie runs through its rom-com paces, but each new scene, while a bit predictable, was nonetheless a pleasure. I felt uplifted by the end, and am very glad I went, even in the blizzard occurring where I am now staying. It was worth it!', 'Jim Carrey, a man who has delivered some of the most memorable comedies of the 90\'s: Ace Ventura, Liar Liar, Dumb and Dumber, and the Mask. He used to be one of the funniest men alive, now it\'s just kind of odd, he\'s gone into the drama genre in films, which is good, he\'s actually proved to be a good actor. But with the comedy, it\'s like he was once the person who you would be first to invite to the party because he was so funny, now he\'s the guy who invites himself to the party and laughs at his own jokes. I think because he\'s older it\'s just awkward watching him trying so hard to make people laugh. Not that Yes Man is a bad film, it\'s just a different version of Liar Liar, yet he\'s not even hypnotized into saying yes to everything, he just does so because he thinks it\'ll make his life better. So instead of feeling bad for him you just go ""ummm, are you an idiot?"". I don\'t wanna know if a man hit on him if he had to say yes to that too.Los Angeles bank employee Carl Allen has become withdrawn and depressed since his divorce from ex-wife Stephanie. Routinely ignoring his friends, he has grown used to spending his spare time watching DVDs alone in his apartment. His outlook on life has become inherently negative. But when a friend persuades him to attend the ""Yes!"" self-improvement seminar, motivational guru Terrence Bundley publicly browbeats him into making a covenant with himself. Carl reluctantly promises to stop being a ""No Man"" and vows to answer ""Yes!"" to every opportunity, request or invitation that presents itself thereafter. After the seminar he meets Allison, an eccentric young woman who is refueling her scooter. After this experience, Carl adopts a positive mentality and seizes every opportunity that comes his way. He takes flying lessons, attends Korean language classes, learns to play the guitar, and even joins a Persian dating website. Saying ""yes"" constantly works to Carl\'s advantage. As their relationship blossoms, Carl and Allison meet at the airport for a spontaneous weekend excursion. But while checking in for the flight, Carl is detained by FBI agents, who have profiled him as potential terrorist because he has taken flying lessons, studied Korean, approved a loan to a fertilizer company, met an Iranian mail-order bride, and bought plane tickets at the last minute. Then Allison begins to doubt whether his commitment to her was ever sincere.Yes Man is over all a good comedy, it has a few good laughs here and there. I think the plot just needed a bit of work, because like I said before it\'s just odd that he isn\'t hypnotized into saying yes constantly, he just does so because someone told him to do it. Yeah, it brought him to some great moments in his life, but he ordered a bride? He\'s just a little bit crazy. But over all I\'d have to say that this movie is more of a rental vs. a theater experience. Jim Carrey can still make you laugh, but not the same as he used to, it\'s just time to grow up, how long can you make those stupid faces for without looking ridicules being a grown man? Well, the money helps I guess.6/10', 'The premise is good: that kind of sectarian gregariousness that turns people into a brainwashed flock, only to scream ""Yes! Yes! Yes!"" at a ridiculous guru\'s finger-snapping - and its impact over one\'s life.AND, for almost one third of the movie, the humor works well; Carrey is his old self (old - also in the negative sense: again, again, AGAIN the same grimaces!), but at least we guffaw in laughter often enough.Unfortunately, around half-ways, the script turns messy, dissociated, incoherent... it departs the efficient logic that had led it till then. And the fun gets repetitive and ever more tired...In the end, it leaves us with the fateful question: ""And so, what...?"" But, at least, it is some comedy... Mediocre, but still amusing... Not as the tons of trash that the Hollywood showbiz delivers all year long, under the Apatow and Seltzer signature. Thank God for the small favors - and small time comedies!', 'The banker Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) is a lonely man with low self-esteem after his divorce with Stephanie (Molly Sims), for whom he still yearns; he avoids his best friend Peter (Bradley Cooper); he has a boring job, stalled in a bureaucratic position in the loan department of a bank; and he spends his spare time watching DVDs. When he meets by chance his former high school mate Nick (John Michael Higgins), he is convinced to participate of a self-help program called ""Yes Man"" leaded by the guru Terrence Bundley (Terence Stamp). The basic principle of the program is to say ""yes"" to new situations, leaving the negativism aside. Carl misunderstands the concept and says ""yes"" to every question. While leaving the encounter, he helps a homeless man and in the end of the night he meets the gorgeous Allison (Zooey Deschanel) that helps him with her scooter. His life completely changes with his new attitude: he becomes closer to his manager Norman (Rhys Darby) and is finally promoted in the bank; he experiences the most surrealistic and the weirdest situations, and becomes successful and with many friends, until the day that he discovers that sometime a ""no"" is necessary for an answer.""Yes Man"" is a good romance that highlights the importance of changing attitude in life. Carl Allen is a very negative man that has no progress in his lonely life, but when he changes his behavior and becomes a positive man, he achieves love and success. The story has many absurd situations, but is very funny. I like Jim Carrey and this role is tailored for him. The cute Zooey Deschanel shows a great chemistry with him and the result is an entertaining movie with a good message in the end. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Sim Senhor"" (""Yes Sir"")', 'Being lucky, I already saw ""Yes Man"" and was pleasantly surprised. Jim Carrey is not really my all time favorite (despite his comic talent and acting skills), but in this movie he seems to have hit the spot.The story itself is really simple: Carl (Jim Carrey), a very negative man, goes to a meeting among the very positive Yes people, whose charismatic leader (Terence Stamp) preaches that one should say Yes to all questions and agree with all propositions. Carl is reluctantly convinced to try it out, and after meeting a girl on a scooter (the ever so lovely Zooey Deschanel) all sorts of things start happening around him. But being 100% positive might be tricky sometimes...It is all very silly, of course - but this feel-good comedy has a small undertone of seriousness as well. And it has a great cast, many delightful scenes, a reasonably relaxed Jim Carrey and a lighthearted style. Y/N? I say Y.', 'I saw this movie as a early showing and having gotten the tickets for free I said ""what the heck, I\'ll see anything for free"". So right off the bat I went in with low expectations. The previews made it look like the same old Jim Carrey Schtick. However, I was pleasantly surprised. There was no ridiculous plot line (Liar Liar) or over the top characters (Ace Ventura) but a simple yet humorous story-line that is played to perfection by Carrey. There were plenty of good chuckles to be had and some down right laughs (and yes for those into it, a gross out scene that will make even this amazingly desensitized movie going generation cringe).Overall, Yes Man is definitely worth the 10 bucks or so that movies are now ridiculously priced out now a days. But most definitely worth the trip if its free :-p. *7/10*', 'After seeing ""The Number 23"" I was beginning to wonder if Jim Carrey had renounced his trademark physical comedy roles he played to such great effect in ""Bruce Almighty"", ""Liar, Liar"", ""Dumb & Dumber"", etc.Carrey is back in form with ""Yes Man"". While the plot was lacking and somewhat formulaic, it was fun to watch the best physical comedy talent of our generation doing what he does best for two hours. Zooey Deschanel was good as the love interest (and she did a nice job singing to).If you liked Carrey\'s earlier works, you\'ll find plenty to like in this movie. I hope Carrey keeps on doing these comedies. It\'s what he was born to do.', ""I always get excited about a new Jim Carrey movie. In my opinion, he has rarely done anything unwatchable in whatever genre from The Mask to Liar Liar via Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind. Yes Man is an excellent feel-good comedy with an outstanding turn from Jim Carrey, Zooey Deschanel & Terence Stamp. The movie is unfortunately predictable (like most Jim Carey flicks) but very enjoyable with a hard-to-ignore message about how people should live their lives. Don't be surprised after seeing the film to start saying yes a bit more often and how much of a difference it may have on your daily life. Yes Man is a worthy addition to Jim Carrey's filmography."", 'Yes ManDirected by Peyton Reed. Starring Jim Carrey, Zooey Deschanel and Bradley Cooper.In the late \'90s, Jim Carrey decided he\'d had enough of playing the silly goofball and started on a path to more serious films like ""The Truman Show."" Ten years later, he\'s had his share of hits, but for the most part, his comedic efforts have fallen flat. Excusing 2003\'s fairly enjoyable ""Bruce Almighty"", Carrey hasn\'t had much recent success with the genre that he once dominated (""Fun with Dick and Jane"", anyone?).In ""Yes Man"", the skilled physical comedian has dusted off the cobwebs and is back in good form. Carrey really seems to be enjoying himself, putting on his best game face and immersing himself in the sight gags and slapstick madness that were so commonplace in his earlier films. He hasn\'t lost his touch or his talent at making people laugh, and he makes sure that the audience knows it.Truthfully, the plot to ""Yes Man"" is irrelevant. Carl Allen (Carrey), a man afraid of living life, challenges himself to say \'yes\' to everything for an entire year. Hilarity ensues and in the end, everyone learns a lesson. It\'s nothing more than a vehicle to showcase Carrey\'s ability. But really, which one of his comedies isn\'t? There are no unexpected twists or surprise endings, just Jim Carrey doing what Jim Carrey does best. Everything else is secondary.The film is rounded out rather nicely by a few of its supporting players. Zooey Deschanel is a cute and bubbly romantic interest who even adds a bit of mayhem to the proceedings, instead of being relegated to straight-man status. ""Flight of the Conchords\'"" Rhys Darby shines as Carl\'s Harry Potter-obsessed co-worker. However, some of the cast feels extraneous. Bradley Cooper and ""That \'70s Show\'s"" Danny Masterson are given little to do, and contribute little as a result. The missed opportunities are irksome, but will do little to affect one\'s enjoyment of the film.""Yes Man"" is a fun time waiting to be had for those who know what to expect. The movie is generally funny throughout, but not clever or inventive enough to justify a second look. It\'s the kind of entertainment that leaves you chuckling, but won\'t be remembered long after viewing. The biggest thing going for the film is that it has re-energized Jim Carrey. He\'s an absolute joy to watch; one only wishes that ""Yes Man"" could keep up with him.Final Grade: C+', ""Yes Man follows the same basic genre comedy structure that we've seen an endless amount of times in the past few years. The main character has a big problem, they work to solve that problem, the problem is solved and happy times are had. Then another problem arises as a result to the solution to the original problem. So everyone is sad. But then that problem is solved and everyone lives happily ever after. And there's a message about how to live your life sprinkled in there. For every single comedy in the past few years with that structure, I've gotten so bored by the time it's over because I just lose interest when the drama comes in during the third act. I either don't care about the characters or I don't care about the message.Every comedy except for this one. Not only did I care about the characters so much (thanks mostly to the performances from Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel who put a beautiful, free-spirited romance at the core of this seemingly typical comedy) that I was emotionally impacted during that predictable turn for the worse near the end, but the message of the film was actually something that I found relatable to my own life which is something I've never experience during these kind of comedies. I'm definitely a man who doesn't really live his life (as cheesy as that sounds) because I isolate myself by making excuses to just be alone and not be with anyone. As a result, I was definitely more invested in this film than I have been with other comedies of the same vein.Add to all this the fact that it's completely hilarious throughout to the point where I have no hesitation in calling it the funniest movie of the year and easily the best straight comedy (not that there have been many good ones; three by my count). Plus, of course, Zooey Deschanel is absolutely infectious in every moment she's on screen (especially her lovely singing). I love her more than air, and this is just another example of why that love is justified. Call it fanboyism if you must, but she's my #2 of the year in supporting actress right now falling second only to the Cruz. In summation, do yourself a favor and say yes to this great comedy.I'm so sorry, I had to say it."", 'I am the biggest Jim Carrey fan I know, whenever a Jim Carrey movie comes out in theaters, I have to see it no matter how bad the premise sounds. I was there for his worse (Fun with Dick and Jane) and I was there for his best (Horton Hears a Who, The Number 23 and Bruce Almighty). As far as this new Jim Carrey venture goes, this is one of his best.Besides Jim Carrey, the movie has a good deal to offer. We have Zooey Deschannel, beautiful and talented, singing new age music in the fictitious band ""Munchausen by Proxy."" Zooey was perfect for this movie because the crew could\'ve had someone lame like Maggie Gyllenhaal or Cameron Diaz play in this. Zooey is really one of those new actresses who is daring and free spirited in her roles, thank God she starred in ELF and got noticed.Okay, now on to the story. A lot of people say that this is too like ""Liar Liar."" Now I have to disagree and agree, it\'s a little similar with ""Liar Liar"" but not too much similar. The story, I find, is more realistic than Liar, as it gives a story we can relate to. I\'m sure a lot of us are still brooding over that boyfriend/girlfriend we broke up with, and we just become zombie\'s after that, avoiding anything fun or exciting. The movie offers a good point, if you don\'t feel like going back to your old life, try a new and exciting life. The plot is kinda simple, but that\'s what comedy is about, being simple and taking a break from the serious plots like ""The Departed"" or ""The Dark Knight."" So when going to the movies and asked if you\'d want to go see ""Yes Man,"" there is only only answer for that. Guess what it is.', 'Being a teenager in the 1990\'s, I have to say I was never a big fan of Jim Carrey\'s mainstream performances in the movies that made him the star that he is today. Hits like Ace Ventura, Dumb & Dumber and Liar Liar left me mostly indifferent to Carrey\'s rather obscene personality. It was only when he shined in more complex roles like The Truman Show, Man on the Moon and eventually Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind that I grew to respect the wide range of characters Carrey is able to bring to life.Over recent years, Carrey continued doing his thing, moving from comedy to dramatic roles and vice versa. The problem is that all of the sudden he wasn\'t alone in the ring anymore, and countless other comedians have tried to slip into his shoes to various degrees of success. There was no place to deny it; Carrey was in need of a hit to re-establish his place in the Hollywood sky.Cue the brand new comedy Yes Man, that finds Carrey once again in his favorite ""What if...?"" sub-genre. This time around, he plays Carl, a lonely divorcée that has somehow alienated even his best friend (portrayed successfully by Wedding Crasher\'s Bradley Cooper). Carl is stuck in a dead-end job at a bank, yearns for his ex-wife and spends his evenings watching rented DVDs... all by himself. When an old friend introduces him to a corny self-help program (lead by a hilarious Terrence Stamp) that persuades him to answer ""yes"" to every question thrown his way, Carl\'s life takes a dramatic turn.As expected, the new approach gets our hero into all kinds of wacky situations - such as spending a steamy morning with his horny elderly neighbor (!); meeting a potential Iranian wife through an online service; partying all night whilst drinking countless cans of Red-Bull and over excessively helping a homeless person. Luckily enough, it also introduces him to the extremely free-spirited Allison (portrayed by the ever-so-cute Zooey Dashnel).If you\'ve seen the average Carrey comedy, you can probably guess how the plot unfolds from here on out, necessary complications included. The format is more or less the same of what we\'ve been used to seeing Carrey perform in his comic outings, with the main idea being a modern moral story urging people to stop going through the motions of life and start seizing the day. But I digress. It seems as though years of perfecting his comic roles as well as starring in more ""grown up"" roles have tamed Carrey a bit. A lot of the arrogance and awkwardness revolving his earlier films seem to be missing this time out, and instead I could actually feel true emotion and heart in Yes Man. It seems as if this fact alone contributed greatly to the fact that most of the punch lines actually worked here and I found myself smiling for the larger part of the film.Some points that still managed to ruin some of the fun are: A. As mentioned above, the film was very predictable, and formulated at that. B. Carrey has definitely aged recently, and it\'s starting to show. The age gap between him and Dashnel left me feeling somewhat uncomfortable.However, all in all I had a great time with some excellent laughs - and at the end of the day that\'s what really counts (:', '""Yes Man"" is surprisingly good, and here the punch line is everything. Jim Carrey is great in Director Peyton Reed\'s hysterical romantic comedy. Zooey Deschanel is amazingly charming and quirky. In ""Yes Man"" Carrey plays Carl, who has been divorced for 3 years from Stephanie (flighty and hot Molly Sims) and has an uninspired job as a loan officer at Brea Savings in Los Angeles. Carl has pretty much checked out in life. To that end he says ""No"" to all invites. Carl even forgets to attend his best friend Peter\'s (funny Bradley Cooper) engagement party. An old buddy invites Carl to a seminar given by Tony Robbins-like self help guru Terrence Bundley (charismatic Terrence Stamp). Terrence invites Carl to accept the ""covenant"" to say ""Yes"" to everything in life. Reluctantly, Carl accepts.However, there is a point to the screenplay by Nicholas Stoller, Jarrad Paul, and Andrew Mogel based on the book by Danny Wallace. In a great conversation with Carl and Terrence later in the story Carl asks, ""So this is bullsh*t?"" Carl has been so not present in his own life. Obviously, saying ""Yes"" mindlessly to everything is ridiculous. What if taking on saying ""Yes"" as an operating practice is a way of practicing being enrolled in life. When you are enrolled in life, and become enrolling, you are now open to a new realm of possibility. Reed and his writers present this transformed perspective in both a hysterical and touching manner.Saying ""Yes"" immediately does not seem to make a difference for Carl. Carl ends up giving a ride and all of his money to Homeless Guy (funny Brent Briscoe). With his cell phone dead and his car empty on gas, Carl ventures miles to a gas station where he meets free-spirited scooter girl Allison (Deschanel). Allison gives Carl a ride, and leaves an indelible mark on his heart. In not the most linear or obvious ways, Carl soon embraces saying ""Yes"". Peter asks, ""So you say \'yes\' to everything?"" Carl confesses, ""I wasn\'t open to stuff. Now I am\x85"" Carl eventually is fated to meet up with Allison. Carl tells Peter that ""\x85She is so not me."" There in lies the genius. There is a quiet moment at the Hollywood Bowl where Allison tells Carl, ""The whole world is a playground. Somewhere along the way everyone forgets that\x85"" Here Reed is unexpectedly poignant. Carrey and Zooey\'s sweet and funny chemistry give ""Yes Man"" its big heart.""Yes Man"" is hysterical. Carrey is at his best playing outrageous comedic with an underlying humanity, instead of straight up serious drama. He is amazingly hysterical as he serenades a Jumper (funny Luis Guzman), takes a drunken beating from an angry boyfriend, and jacked up on Red Bull in a jogging photography class. Zooey Deschanel is Carrey\'s amazing romantic foil. There is a nice scene as she and Carrey walk side by side along a barren Nebraska road. She is cute and has such a radiant spirit and vulnerability. So her Allison must touchingly reconcile for herself whether Carl is just saying ""Yes"". ""Yes Man"" is about what\'s in your heart and being open to all the possibilities of life. That\'s not a bad message for a hilarious and outrageous comedy from Jim Carrey and Peyton Reed. Say ""Yes"" to ""Yes Man"".', 'I went to this film as one of those process-of-elimination things: Valkry had Tom Cruise, my friend had already seen Benjamin Button, Spirit\'s show-times suck, my local theater is idiotic and not showing Doubt or Slumdog Millionaire, all leaving Yes Man which neither of us were enthused about, but hey! it got us out of the house. We were shocked to leave the theater with our lungs hurting. The movie was well thought, well executed, and the humor was smart, snappy, and so far from the usual toilet humor of Jim Carrey. I was throughly and delightfully surprised with this film. On the note of message: I think this film actually has a very valuable message. Never in the history of humankind has the average person had so many opportunities to live life in ways never before imagined, yet never before have we been so isolated. Our computers; our phones; our mp3s and ipods; dare I say it, our movies all keep us isolated from actual social interaction. We are skeptical and judgmental about those who actually seek social interaction and friendship (site: Norman) that we fail to realize we are the ones who are actually lame--we are the ones not gathering with the people we love and those we have yet to meet. We are the ones spending our nights lulled into lame predictability, sitting in front of our TVs, telling characters in films to ""just snap it off already."" Yes Man is not just a fun filled film. It is a well deserved social critique.', 'Despite the fact that I am a huge fan of Carrey, I admit a lot of his comedic performances are somewhat ridiculous. But this is legitimately a sensible comedy where he doesn\'t use a lot of his ""Rubberface"" antics and actually just acts funny. The premise of this film is intriguing and I loved watching it. Both Jim and Zooey are excellent the story is amazing. All the Carrey-haters should give this one a chance, it really deserves it. I think Jim\'s most recent movies have been great. It\'s his older movies that people hate him for. But he\'s becoming a legit dramatic actor who can also be funny. He sometimes goes over the top, but all-in-all he is a multi-faceted professional. This movie deserves a lot of praise because it is excellent. This brings back flashes of his performance in the extremely popular ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". In closing, give ""Yes Man"" a chance. It\'s good for some laughs but also offers a very optimistic view on life in general.', ""I saw a free screening of this hilarious movie in my hometown and it was MAGNIFICENT!!! It starts off fast and never slows down (never a dull moment in the movie) and for fans of Jim Carrey (like me) who wants him to be himself, prepare to laugh so extremely hard that will have your sides in excruciating pain from all the laughter you made!! Jim Carrey was at his very best & he made me laugh non-stop till' the end of the movie but it was not a one-man show, the supporting cast threw in some fantastic delivery lines, humor & craziness. Zooey Deschanel was surprisingly very funny (didn't know she could be THIS funny), Bradley Cooper was funny, Terence Stamp did great as well but out of all of the supporting cast, there are two of them that had some of the funniest scenes in movie history: Rhys Darby plays the memorable and hilarious boss of Carl Allen (Carrey), he had some classic and unbelievable delivery lines in the movie that were just funny. And the other person: Fionnula Flanaghan who plays the nasty, sexually & very funny neighbor of Carl Allen and delivers us one of the most disgusting & very funny scenes in years (not giving you spoilers)!! Yes Man is not only a very, very funny but it sends a good message about how do you want to handle your life."", ""i just saw a screening of this movie,and let me tell you I'm impressed with this movie.i think this on of Jim Carey's best movies in a long time,great scenes,great humour,great plot and Jim Carey doing this movie really blend in and make this move work.i may have never laughed so hard as i did in this movie in a long time.Jim Carey really delivers his performance,and you could see it on the screen that he worked hard for this movie and tried to make it work.other supporting actors do a great job.All you guys if you're looking for a laugh,watch this movie cause you guys will die laughing!i give this movie a thumbs up and you guys wont regret watching YES MAN when you leave the theater!"", ""I had a chance to see an advance screening of Yes Man last night and I have to say it's one of his best comedies since Me, Myself & Irene. I've always been a fan of Jim Carey, whether he's doing juvenile comedy like Ace Venture or adult orientated drama like the highly underrated Man On The Moon; & Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. Making his first live action film since Fun With Dick & Jane, Carey once again shows his talent as a comic. Early trailers have the film coming off as a Liar Liar rehash, but looking deeper the film is more about than belly laughs and one-liners. It's refreshing to see Carey bring freshness to a role he could easily play in his sleep; one particular scene with Scotch tape had the preview audience in tears. Zooey Deshuncaal more than makes up for the debacle that was The Happening and displays the same likable charm she displayed in Elf, and hopefully she continues to play romantic leads in the future. All in all this is a fine film and if you're looking for a break from the profanity filed gross out comedies of recent memory, then say yes to Yes Man."", 'First of all I would like to say that this movie might seem like Liar Liar at first sight, but it is not!I think this movie is both funny and sweet. What if one word could change everything? I found myself wondering this after leaving the cinema, and I left it with a satisfied feeling of quality.This is the best Jim Carrey movie I have seen in years. I really enjoyed it and so did the rest of the audience too...And I love the soundtrack on this, the song he has as a ring-tone, Journey - Separate Ways (Worlds Apart) is great, fantastic! I feel real good when I heard it, and the movie made me smile, but not just smile, also feel something! I felt real joy!!I must congratulate the director and the cast for a job well done! You made a movie that really works, and for that I am grateful! Good movies are rear these days. 9/10 for me, will buy it on blue-ray when it comes.']",21,['Comedy']

As a snarky jab at the music industry, Brian Epstein's meticulous eye for detail is hearkened and contrasted with Kate McKinnon, whose performance is at once spot on and over the top. Her character is undoubtedly the tip of the iceberg for those archetype 'gonna conquer the world' southern California denizens, yet rings hollow in a few spots. The distinction is poignant for a Danny Boyle movie, normally the complete opposite of tone deaf, and while I chose to include it here, the scene(s) I reference may be cut from the final release version. (For edification purposes: the music studio in L.A.)Speaking of the studio, The Beatles, simply would not be without the mastery of studio producer George Martin. The orchestral arrangements, the sound story mentality, the embracing of The Beatles' desire to embrace the latest technologies are a few of the ways in which Martin guided the manifestation of magic conveyed on vinyl. The film, in this regard, is light on the complexity and development of the sound over time and focuses instead, even acknowledges, that Jack's is a lesser reflection of the brilliance of The Beatles, with a few laugheties about lyric selection.Which is not to say that the interpretations of the songs chosen are not without merit. The sincere portrayal of 'Yesterday' provides a solid framing for the rest of the movie. 'In my Life' plays a vital role in driving the movie forward, and appropriately so. And the at once nuanced, yet in your face pleading of 'Help' is a true reading of the song's rarely spoken meaning appropriate to the character and plot. Patel's rendering, spoken and sung, is true.What is a bit muddled is the inability for interpersonal communication in a world without a common language of love, alongside earworm hooks, impeccably delivered by John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Instead it takes a plot twist I didn't anticipate, to initiate the third half of the movie resolution.Ultimately, the movie succeeds at contemplating how a struggling musician / teacher might navigate the complicated waters of being the one person in the world who remembers and can perform The Beatles...A Long and Winding Road indeed!"", 'Just left the TriBeCa Film Festival where the film premiered, and I have to say, the film was superb.

That is exactly what makes the piece so marvellous; I came out of the cinema with a greater appreciation of The Beatles, and their music, through a fictional story that did not feature the four men we are familiar with at all.

Yoga Hosers,3.46,3.64,"['Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Thriller']",Two teenage yoga enthusiasts must do battle with an evil presence that is threatening to rise from its underground lair and endanger their major party plans.,fear,"['Now when I first saw the trailer to Kevin Smith\'s (Clerks, Dogma) Yoga Hosers I was a little surprised. Now for those who have not seen the trailer for this film, and are asking yourself ""What the Hell are some Yoga Hosers?"" The trailer focuses on the two Canadian girls from Smith\'s last film, Tusk. Who work at a convenience store, and encounter Nazi sausages. Seriously. When I saw the trailer, my immediate instinct reaction was ""What the f*ck?"" It wasn\'t that what the f*ck with anger, it wasn\'t what the f*ck with confusion, it really was just a simple what the f*ck. Now I love Kevin Smith films. He always seemed like a cool person, he is well spoken, writes scripts with compelling characters and story, and he seems like the kind of guy you could easily talk with. His last film Tusk, in my opinion was his worst film. The films plot was there and it sounded great. What I personally didn\'t enjoy was the pace of the film and the characters. At least that film had a story wrapped around in it. Most people, including myself love the art form of filmmaking and movies for two main reasons. That being a story the audience can connect to and characters and audience can connect to. In my opinion, Yoga Hosers has very little story, with characters an audience cannot connect to, it isn\'t that funny, it\'s annoying, and I personally didn\'t get it.I do not know if Kevin Smith made this film to mess with critics, the media, and fans. Or is he just this bad of a filmmaker now? Sadly, out there in the world there really is an individual who has a film script. A film script with story, compelling characters, a story that is a breath of fresh air, and a script that is really written with heart. Unfortunately, we may never have a chance to see it, because Kevin Smith had to bring us f*cking Yoga Hosers. Sorry Ah-Boot ThatI don\'t know where to start with this film. For God\'s sake, there is even a Marvel cameo of Stan Lee in this! I didn\'t go into this movie thinking it was terrible. I saw it on Netflix, went in with a clear unbiased mind, and 80 minutes later I\'m shocked. The one good part of this movie is Harley Quinn Smith and Lily-Rose Depp. Those two actually to capture the spirit of Clerks in a way. I found them to be a little funny. But the rest of it is just bad acting and really bad Canadian jokes. They run the same joke into the ground over and over and over and over again. I didn\'t know it was possible to offend and be prejudice towards Canadians. After seeing this movie, well Goddamn it is possible if you\'re Kevin Smith. We f*cking get it, Canadians say EH (A) ever so often. When they say about, sometimes it sounds like they are saying Ah- boot. At first it is a chuckle. After that, it is just sad; the whole movie is Eh and Ah-boot! That damn title card pops up every ten minutes when they introduce a character is bad! It looks like a want to be Scott Pilgrim and Suicide Squad.The cast is talented, but the story and they way it\'s written is completely ridiculous. Pucky Charms cereal ever ten minutes in your face, terrible Canadian slang jokes, looks like a 1990s video game in 2016, and this is the director of Clerks, Dogma, and Chasing Amy. There is no way in Hell this movie was made seriously, it is clearly a joke. A joke I personally do not find funny.This film is worse than Tusk. If you enjoyed it, I am more than glad you did. Maybe I just don\'t get the joke. Kevin Smith\'s down dude since day one is in this, Mr. Jason Mewes! And even he is in this for two minutes, with the look on his face like yeah I don\'t need this right now. Really it is a shame, it\'s a mess, and I will always like and respect Kevin Smith. But recently his work, his legacy, his films have gone so far down the sh*tter I don\'t think he can cleanly come back up. Sorry Ah-boot that, yeah you should be sorry for this sh*t you call a movie!I believe this ""movie"" earns a\x852 out of 10.Worst Kevin Smith film.', ""I love Kevin Smith. Seriously think he's one of the most engaging, funny, clever people going around. I've been a regular at his Smodcasts, live shows, q&a's, watched all his movies, twitter feed etc etc, so it pains me to say that this is one of the biggest pieces of sh!t I have ever seen. An in joke wankfeast from start to finish, I gave it 2 stars rather than one only to honour the memory of his early funny films and what an all round good dude he seems to be in general. It's great that Kev has the money to do whatever and indulge whoever the f@ck he wants, I'd love to have that life too. But I don't, so I had to put up with wasting 90 minutes of my life being smacked around by the snotty end of Big Kev's fuckstick. The most entertaining part was Ralph Gorman doing his Hollywood BabbleOn schtick without having to do call outs to drunken white trash from the third world suburbs of bumfuck Idaho. When Kevin announced his retirement from movies I was disappointed, but after this unfunny self indulgent Wankapalooza, I'd rather he stuck to the talk circuit where he's still awesome as hell."", 'Would have worked better as a ""Grindhouse"" type film. I can tell this was supposed to be comedy, but almost every joke fell flat. There were only minor amusing moments, but they were so scattered across the run time that your search for them would not even be worth it.I wish Kevin Smith wouldn\'t do all the science fiction elements, because they don\'t blend well with the established tone. And It makes everything more ridiculous to be honest. I would have enjoyed a more down to Earth comedy. If you wanna keep the weird monsters and over the top scientists, then set the tone up better from the start. Because the first act is like a cheap Rom- com. It just takes you by surprise when it switches gears. I don\'t have anything against the Avantgarde genre, but here it just didn\'t work well.What are the positives? There\'s an entertaining flashback scene with Haley Joel Osment. He is completely over acting and it\'s one of the few scenes which could be funny to some people. Johnny Depp shows up, and his ex-wife and two of his kids (one is playing the lead) as well. Even Kevin Smith\'s daughter co-stars. So, this is a family film? Maybe it is nice to see these two families be friends and make a funny movie together. You can see they all had fun and they are not taking it seriously for one second.It feels like the Depp\'s and the Smith\'s were just hanging out for a weekend and just for the fun of it decided to make a movie. They invited a few friends too. I guess it\'s all an in-joke to them, but for the rest of the world? Not so much.', 'Saw the ""premier"" in NJ. First off, let me say Kevin Smith seems like a genuinely good dude. Actually - he is undoubtedly a great dude. Listening to him speak about film and the whole process was inspiring. It seemed like I was hearing one of my buddies talk. Very down to earth- but at the same time he\'ll throw out something ridiculous - but hilarious. Listening to him speak was arguably better than the movie. For the record- I wouldn\'t consider myself a HUGE Kevin Smith fan. I like him- but you know. I\'m not one of the die hard Kevin Smith fans. I respect the hell out of him. I must admit though, I haven\'t seen his latest films.""Yoga Hosers"" had its moments. Johnny Depp is almost unrecognizable and had everyone laughing. For him to go from Black Mass to this is mind-boggling. Talk about versatility. The two main girls might not sit well with people - but with Mr Smiths prologue - I understood their performances. They are supposed to be brats who are obsessed with their cell phones. The movie has a bunch of cameos whom people will recognize from the past and enjoy seeing again. It also had a cool 80\'s arcade vibe. It\'s obviously not meant to receive Oscars or critical acclaim; but, nevertheless, it\'s a fun flick- with some interesting performances. The story itself is silly- in that unique Kevin Smith way. I did feel bad after at the Q and A when he kept saying he was a crappy filmmaker and that he has no skill (comparing himself to Tarantino). I know he\'s being humble, but it just didn\'t seem right hearing that. Clerks, Dogma, Mallrats? Classics man. He represents NJ well. I wanted to shout out but I was working. I think he just felt it was important to acknowledge the haters, and I respect that.So- yeah. This is a tough movie to review. The best way to put it - it\'s so bad it\'s good. I think that\'s the point. It definitely had funny moments. Even some creepy ones. It is a comedy though - before anything else. It\'s a movie for all ages really. The theater was sold out and cracking up. I do kinda wish they used less CGI - but for this type of story - it is somewhat necessary. It\'s a shame people have labeled it as ""a play date"" just because of the father /daughter + father/daughter thing. That\'s what Mr. Smith said at least. Overall, if you\'re feeling up for a weird, funny B - movie and you\'re a fan of Kevin Smith and Johnny Depp- I suppose it\'s worth a watch. I had a good time. Like I said- it\'s so bad it\'s good.6/10P.S. Very cool to learn Kevin Smith and I were born at the same hospital. Riverview Medical Center.', ""Kevin Smith definitely didn't shoot for the moon, or aim to make this for everyone, or even most...he made this for his fans from the Podcast, and to give his daughter an avenue to stretch her new found skills.The movie is fun. the performances in it all shine at different moments...the two standouts being Johnny Depp as Guy Lapointe and Tony Hale as Lily-Rose Depp's Dad...Solid and funny.The girls grew on me after awhile...which was surprising, only to the fact that watching teen girls on their phones and chatting back and forth...in real life can be annoying...But Smith makes it funny, and paced well.Overall...if the preview intrigues you...see it.If not...it's OK to skip...it's not for you."", ""I have seen reviews here bashing the movie. Yoga Hosers is no Godfather. This is obvious. I have been watching Kevin Smith movies for nearly 25 years. Instead, look at the fun the actors are having. This movie stars Johnny Depp, his kids, with Kevin Smiths daughter, Johnny Depp's ex girlfriend and mother of his children, Kevin Smith and wife, Jason Mewes, Stan The Man Lee....all of these people friends. It was done for fun, and to poke fun at Canada and millenial culture. If I had the pull and the money, I'd do it too. Kevin Smith does this, every now and then grabs up his friends and makes something silly, and goes back to making the movies that earn huge amounts of money. Does no one remember the line from Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back? You make the safe film, then you make the art film. And sometimes, you make a film for your friends. That is Kevin Smith. Sometimes he just wants to have fun with his friends. The relationship Kevin Smith has with his daughter is one that every father should dream of having. Or am I the only one moved by seeing Harley Quinn Smith in tears when Kevin Smith gave her the bat used by Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad as a gift? And Depp. It is like he has a side of him that reasonates with Kevin Smith. He plays a lot of roles in movies, but seeing him onscreen during one scene with his daughter and cracking wise that she may not be old enough for what he is talking about was great. The movie is not in my top fifty, but it was nice to see friends and family making jokes and enjoying themselves."", 'It started with a great song, has some charming girls as the protagonists and a ton of celebrity actors that came in to bring their support. Some of the jokes are hilarious and the setup was awesome.Imagine this movie starring the Depp and Smith daughters, with their families in tow: Johnny Depp, Vanessa Paradis, Jack Depp, Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes, with support from the likes of Haley Joel Osment, Justin Long, Austin Butler. Stan Lee is in this movie! And it\'s a Canadian parody with Yoga hosers chicks fighting devil worshipers and Nazis ""the Yoga way"". Wow!And now jump to the film itself which, with this much going for it, barely scratched the average. After the first 30 minutes I was thinking up funny ways of congratulating Kevin Smith for this funny and imaginative movie. After that, though, it all went downhill.I guess the biggest quarrel with the thing is its inconsistency, jumping from great fun to silly and to plain bad and back again in a matter of seconds. Kevin, I love you, but you need to think your scripts through, man!', 'Seen it at the BIFFF of Brussels (Brussels fantastic film festival)it is well...quite different from tusk except if you are Canadian because again it is bringing up stereotypes unless you are OK with that kind of humor.Of course again it is a crazy story, has nothing to do with TUSK except the girls and Depp and that it is set in Canada.The story starts with a totally unlikely story, that sets the surrealistic theme.I think of course that a lot of people will not like it, but at the screening most of the reviews were like ""eh? what is that thing??"" or ""wow, i had a great laugh"". Me i laughed a lot especially the WW2 references that are totally nuts.Again as always with his films, go with an open mind, do not expect anything and let yourself drown into his universe.', ""These movies are only amazing if you are a true Kevin smith fan which means all forms Of his media. Some of the funnier parts in the movie are references to his podcast. The placement of these scattered through the movie are perfect. Listen to Smodcast, Edumacation, Hollywood babble on and others to really find it funny. Kevin Smith is not in a period of his filmmaking career where he cares about making money. He could Produce the rest of his life and be perfectly fine. He's making movies he wants to make and his podcast listeners want to see. Not as good as tusk, but I think he made this one for his loyal fan base and wanted to work with his daughter."", ""Imagine Clerks meets Ghoulies. It was supposed to be a kids movie, but ended up as a midnight movie that kids can't see yet. It was hilarious. It was weird. It was different. There were callbacks to old movies. You might want to re-watch some of the old stuff before going in to watch this one. There were awesome cameos. The king of cameos makes an appearance. The story is pretty original like most of Kevin's stuff. Killer Nazi sausages try to take over Canada. How high do you have to be to come up with that? Silent Bob high. That's how high you have to be. Johnny Depp, his daughter, and Kevin's daughter had me holding my sides at times. Please see this and enjoy it as much as I did. Huge Kevin Smith fan, so yes I am a bit biased, and I was lucky enough to see this at a sneak preview hosted by the man."", ""Great movie! Really loved this film probably my favorite film of 2016 so far really funny and unique! Also great acting job from Lily-Rose Depp and Harley Quinn Smith really looking forward to seeing more from them in the future! This is a great film if you love things from the 80s and 90s a really great nostalgia film! And i am a huge fan of Tusk and i think this was a perfect spin off of that and i think it was a really good idea to make a film revolving around the Colleens it was really unexpected but a really great idea! I'm really looking forward to Moose Jaws and cant wait to see where that goes and also i got to view Yoga Hoser at one of Kevin's early screenings and it was a blast!!!"", ""If you were a fan of marvel's infinity war, you're going to be left speechless by this tasty morsel.Yoga hosers is stunning and brave political commentary in these turbulent and trying times. Bold and unapologetic, which is striking for a film about canada, this film can and should be watched as the shawshank for the millennial generation.If tusk was a perfect metaphor for animal rights activism, Yoga hosers stares unblinkingly into the political climate of modern Canada, diving into the real issues: metaphorical tiny sauerkraut filled brat clones of nazi scientists, and the scourge of art criticism which drives good men to evil.the acting was phenomenal, with Depp again reprising his role as Guy Lapointe, again with the same delicacy and skill expected by such a seasoned talent. The main standout however was Kevin smith, we knew he could direct, but man, what a fantastic actor. The Stan Lee cameo was also the best in any marvel movie thus far, I would explain it, but I don't want to spoil one of the most heart wrenching scenes since Marley and me.The best part, this movie is loosely based on true events, Adrien Arcand being a real person who apparently actually wanted to send Jewish Canadians to the Hudson bay. I had initially thought that this part of the film was a bit far fetched for such a grounded work, however it's just another example of reality being stranger than fiction.don't be sorry about liking this film, it's not the yoga way."", ""I loved it. I loved that it was a family affair all around. Kevin Smith's daughter, and then Johnny Depp, Lily-Rose, and even Vanessa Paradis. Come on, how much fun is that?! I loved Johnny Depp's character, freaking hilarious. I was cracking up at all the Canadian jokes and bad accents. Justin Long and Adam Brody were fun as well. Its absurd, and its a bunch of puns. Which is exactly what I love. Plus it had a pretty awesome Scott Pilgrim feel to it. This a good movie for easy laughs, awesome puns, fun easter eggs, and actually some damn good comedic acting. Its supposed to be over the top and they did it right. #Soarrynotsoarry I loved it!"", ""Although on surface level this film may appear to be nothing more than an unserious flick, however I would argue otherwise. In order to truly grasp the deeper meaning of this fine film one must turn to the tragic background of the main antagonist - longing to become a world-famous artist, Andronicus Arcane finds himself continuously shot down by harsh art critics that fail to understand his vision.Fed up with continually being lambasted, he withdraws into himself, eventually coming to the realization that he wasn't born to merely be a fine artist, but rather a creator of life. He then goes to work creating bratwurst beings pulled from his own DNA that he then freezes along with himself, timed to wake up within a hundred years. However, his plans take an unexpected turn when him and his bratwurst companions are unexpectedly awoken by the two Colleens.Eventually he decides to unveil his newest sculpture to the Colleens, and upon receiving constructive/good feedback he feels as if at last he has made it. He puts his bratwurst creations into the sculpture, directing his children to destroy his haters. However, things take a dark turn quickly when his own creation turns on him and kills him.It's a tale full of unfulfilled dreams, personal anguish, and pathos. It's a modern Greek tragedy - Frankenstein reinterpreted - a story that delves into the depths of man and his relationship to his creations, and how man has the ability to overstep his boundaries and into the realm of God, only to be shot down for his hubris. The film also discusses the topic of life and art - how art imitates life far more than life imitates art, and how art is the giving of oneself over wholly to expression, whether that form of expression be visual or otherwise. One can only achieve a masterpiece when one creates something that is timeless in its truth, and honest in its perspective concerning the human experience. That being said, I must be obliged to give the film a 10/10, as I felt that it has explored the depths of the human soul and experience.""]",14,"['Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Thriller']"

After an awkward reunion and family dinner, Marni and her younger brother Ben decide to do what they can to derail the nuptials.Kristen Bell is a very pretty girl, and it couldn\'t have been easy to transform her into the unattractive high school geek that Marni was supposed to have been. Yet make-up artists and Bell\'s adoption of some less than pretty tics make you believe in the earlier version of Marni. Odette Yustman also does a good job as the pretty, popular girl whose mission in life is to make Marni miserable. Some of the movie\'s best moments come, though, as the result of the past and present rivalry between Jamie Lee Curtis and Sigourney Weaver. I\'d be very surprised if the two of them had less than a ball doing their scenes together because it certainly shows on screen that way.The story itself is relatively predictable, and the direction, while competent, is nothing special. The script is marred by moments of melodrama that undermine the otherwise marginal believability of the story, and though the actors handle their lines well, even genuine talent isn\'t enough to overcome some of the things they must say and do. In particular, poor Kristen Chenoweth in a role as the wedding planner—an actress I consider a truly brilliant talent—is stuck in a role where the caricature overwhelms even her formidable abilities. While Betty White (who portrays Marni\'s Grandma Bunny) is also silly, she, at least, gets away with it.BOTTOM LINE: You Again is often diverting, and has enough elements of realism in it to make you recall your own high school days (for good or for ill), but it doesn\'t overcome the limitations imposed on it by its script, or a story that we\'ve all frankly heard before.

Among her chief tormentors was JJ (Odette Yustman), the captain of the cheerleading squad and all around snob. But Marni bucks up and uses the bullying she experienced as a goad toward achievement after graduation. Whatever her motivations, Marni\'s achievements can\'t be questioned: She\'s named a vice president of her public relations firm just before she heads home for her older brother\'s wedding.Marni and her brother Will (Jimmy Wolk) have always been close, and she\'s both devastated and furious when she discovers the bride-to-be is none other than her high school nemesis who now answers to the name Joanna.

""You Again"" opens with Marni telling a group of young PR interns the tale of her life as a nerd in high school. Like many of us, Marni didn\'t have a great time in high school because she was picked on and bullied especially by the lead cheerleader, Joanna (Odette Yustman). After Marni is done with her big speech at the PR firm, she boards a plane to head home to attend her brother Will\'s (James Wolk) wedding. Once home, Marni finds out that Will is marrying Joanna; the woman who made her life in high school a living hell. This is when Marni sets out to prove that Joanna is not this innocent good girl that she is pretending to be. To top all this off, Joanna\'s Aunt Romona (Sigourney Weaver) arrives that same evening only to find out that Marni\'s mother Gail (Jamie Lee Curtis) has a history with her as well. A funny, silly but ultimately clever film ensues...Many reviewers are labeling ""You Again"" as 2010\'s ""Bride Wars"" and while I see a few similarities between the two films, ""You Again"" is a far superior film. I was actually perplexed by the amount of negative press this film received. While it is a far cry from an Oscar worthy, it was still a feel good film with a really funny story and interesting premise. ""You Again"" is a movie about a nerdy high school chick who is bullied by the head cheerleader only to find out years later that her brother is engaged to the woman who ruined four years of her life. A plot like that is ripe for comedy. Furthermore, the movie addresses the theme of confronting and overcoming high school rivalries; a topic I feel very few movies address.One may argue that the film is too silly for it\'s own good. I would have to say that it\'s true especially towards the end but in all honesty its a Hollywood comedy. I would rather it be a bit too silly than a film loaded with sex gags as a filler. There are some really funny scenes in this movie too. I loved the whole car ride scene when Joanna plays ""We are the Champions"" and of course, the dance studio scene. I think sometimes watching actors act like teenagers are funny especially if you can understand where they are coming from. The reaction that Kristen Bell\'s character has when she sees Joanna again is priceless. Try to put yourself in these shoes...you are tortured in high school and get out hoping to never see that person again but find out they are marrying a family member. That\'s like a nightmare of epic portions. The thing I thought was even more humorous about the film was the fact they showed it happens to all generations, not just the younger. I think Jamie Lee Curtis\'s reaction to Weaver\'s entrance was equally priceless.Kristen Bell is the highlight of the film. I always enjoyed her in these types of roles. I find her to be cute and lovable. She plays a good nerd in the beginning and I found it believable because it fits her as a person. Bell doesn\'t seem to have that mass appeal that say Reese Witherspoon has but I do enjoy her films and hope she continues to do films. I would say her character Marni is a bit similar to her character in ""When in Rome,"" however here the character has more depth. It\'s a better written character with more of a background story.As for the other actors, I felt Odette Yustman was just great and like Bell really fit her character. You can tell that she wasn\'t this innocent girl she pretended to be. She plays one hell of a mean girl that\'s for sure. I think she had great chemistry with Bell as enemies. As for Curtis, she\'s good in comedies and I loved her in this film. While she plays the mom role here watching her competing with Sigourney Weaver is a blast.

I should mention Bette White, who absolutely steals the scenes and has a hilarious scene at the films conclusion.I really don\'t know what all the reviewers were complaining about with ""You Again."" I thought the premise was fairly unique and the overall film was fun and full of fluff. The movie was really funny at times even though it used the typical clichés that comedies nowadays tend to use. This is a movie where you just sit back and enjoy a few good laughs. I know as a male, I didn\'t mind watching this film and felt that it wasn\'t like the typical chick flick. The ending was rather typical and overly clichéd but than again that\'s not surprising coming out of Hollywood.All in all,""You Again"" is an enjoyable comedy that I wouldn\'t mind having to watch again. Everyone involved did a great job especially Bell who steals the show and wins the audience over within the first 10 minutes of the film. Just remember people, this is a silly comedy and not a comedic masterpiece. No one should be expecting an Oscar worthy film and if you can get past that you should be able to enjoy to this. I personally think a lot of people have enjoyed this film despite what the critics say because can relate to one of the characters in one way or another. It\'s an cute and enjoyable flick and I recommend those looking for a wholesome laugh to check it out.MovieManMenzel\'s final rating for ""You Again"" is a 7 out of 10.', 'Marni (Kristen Bell) is a successful PR representative, who moved out to Los Angeles as a way to start fresh and forget her past. ""You Again"" opens with Marni telling a group of young PR interns the tale of her life as a nerd in high school. Like many of us, Marni didn\'t have a great time in high school because she was picked on and bullied especially by the lead cheerleader, Joanna (Odette Yustman). After Marni is done with her big speech at the PR firm, she boards a plane to head home to attend her brother Will\'s (James Wolk) wedding. Once home, Marni finds out that Will is marrying Joanna; the woman who made her life in high school a living hell. This is when Marni sets out to prove that Joanna is not this innocent good girl that she is pretending to be. To top all this off, Joanna\'s Aunt Romona (Sigourney Weaver) arrives that same evening only to find out that Marni\'s mother Gail (Jamie Lee Curtis) has a history with her as well. A funny, silly but ultimately clever film ensues...Many reviewers are labeling ""You Again"" as 2010\'s ""Bride Wars"" and while I see a few similarities between the two films, ""You Again"" is a far superior film. I was actually perplexed by the amount of negative press this film received. While it is a far cry from an Oscar worthy, it was still a feel good film with a really funny story and interesting premise. ""You Again"" is a movie about a nerdy high school chick who is bullied by the head cheerleader only to find out years later that her brother is engaged to the woman who ruined four years of her life. A plot like that is ripe for comedy. Furthermore, the movie addresses the theme of confronting and overcoming high school rivalries; a topic I feel very few movies address.One may argue that the film is too silly for it\'s own good. I would have to say that it\'s true especially towards the end but in all honesty its a Hollywood comedy. I would rather it be a bit too silly than a film loaded with sex gags as a filler. There are some really funny scenes in this movie too. I loved the whole car ride scene when Joanna plays ""We are the Champions"" and of course, the dance studio scene. I think sometimes watching actors act like teenagers are funny especially if you can understand where they are coming from. The reaction that Kristen Bell\'s character has when she sees Joanna again is priceless. Try to put yourself in these shoes...you are tortured in high school and get out hoping to never see that person again but find out they are marrying a family member. That\'s like a nightmare of epic portions. The thing I thought was even more humorous about the film was the fact they showed it happens to all generations, not just the younger. I think Jamie Lee Curtis\'s reaction to Weaver\'s entrance was equally priceless.Kristen Bell is the highlight of the film. I always enjoyed her in these types of roles. I find her to be cute and lovable. She plays a good nerd in the beginning and I found it believable because it fits her as a person. Bell doesn\'t seem to have that mass appeal that say Reese Witherspoon has but I do enjoy her films and hope she continues to do films. I would say her character Marni is a bit similar to her character in ""When in Rome,"" however here the character has more depth. It\'s a better written character with more of a background story.As for the other actors, I felt Odette Yustman was just great and like Bell really fit her character. You can tell that she wasn\'t this innocent girl she pretended to be. She plays one hell of a mean girl that\'s for sure. I think she had great chemistry with Bell as enemies. As for Curtis, she\'s good in comedies and I loved her in this film. While she plays the mom role here watching her competing with Sigourney Weaver is a blast. I think everyone involved did a good job with their roles and did what the script requested of them.

Funny enough, he's probably the only true comedian of the bunch. Quite frankly, I can see this as an Adam Sandler movie with all of his gang. I have never heard of Rob Hedden. He seems to have been a Hollywood journeyman. The main issue is that non of this is actually funny. Annable and McPhee are not comedic powerhouses. At best, they're the straight men in a comedy.

Being Croatian myself, really can't see the reason to get overexcited about the fact that some people in Hollywood don't know geography, they have been known to make far greater mistakes in respect to other nations!

She operates a Mom & Pop bookshop, he\'s opening another outlet in his retail chain nearby; they lock horns over business, yet are unaware they are also each other\'s internet pen-pal. Slick and occasionally too-cute, but very entertaining picture with a holiday theme.

Nora and Delia Ephron's script succeeds because they know their characters well, and give them a can't miss plot device.  Tom Hanks is believable as the head of a gigantic bookstore chain, as is Meg Ryan as the owner of a small children's bookstore shop.  As the guy who is putting Meg out of business by opening a chain store close to her little shop, Tom Hanks character comes across as the arrogant person who only goal seems to open as many bookstores as he can, and make as much money as he can in doing so. When he is talking to Meg Ryan on the internet, we see another side of him, and learn that possibly, he's not the evil guy you think he is.  Of course, in person, Meg hates him for what he is doing, on the internet, she falls in love with him.  This is what makes the film work, as their reaction to each other in person is completely different from when they talk on line.

Not that I was required to, but this genre would, after all,  be considered a romantic comedy.

"You, Me and Dupree",2.84,3.21,"['Comedy', 'Romance']","A best man (Wilson) stays on as a houseguest with the newlyweds, much to the couple's annoyance.",sadness,"['Let\'s be honest: There weren\'t a lot of options for new releases this weekend (unless you count yourself a Wayan Brothers fan, and I most certainly do not). That explains in a nutshell how it was that I ended up buying a ticket to see You, Me and Dupree. As it happens, I wasn\'t all that upset that I didn\'t have other viable options. I like Kate Hudson and Matt Dillon just fine, and I really like Owen Wilson (and who doesn\'t after his hysterical turn in The Wedding Crashers?). Unfortunately, I didn\'t like You, Me and Dupree at all.You, Me and Dupree opens with the wedding of Carl Peterson (Matt Dillon) and his pretty fiancée, Molly (Kate Hudson) in Hawaii. Carl\'s best friend, Randy Dupree (Owen Wilson), has been tapped to be his best man. Dupree\'s antics at the wedding celebration alone gives Molly \x97 and the rest of us \x97 something of a taste of his ne\'er do well lifestyle. The wedding toasts also give us a good look at Molly\'s real estate magnate father, the judgmental Bob Thompson (Michael Douglas).In the way of many young and very much in love couples, neither Dupree nor Mr. Thompson can sully Carl and Molly\'s big day. When they return from their honeymoon, however, the trouble begins. Carl works for Mr. Thompson, and soon finds himself in over his head largely because Mr. Thompson wants to see him there. Meanwhile, Dupree can\'t hold a job at all and ends up broke and with nowhere else to go on the Peterson\'s doorstep. Molly reluctantly agrees that Dupree can stay with them ""for a few days."" Over the course of the next week or so, we\'re ""treated"" to a series of toilet and masturbation jokes; a stuffed moose head lying on the hearth; and more than a few life lessons from a man who won\'t grow up but who ""lives, loves, and laughs"" to the fullest. We also have to watch Carl be sorely used and abused by his boss and father-in-law even as Dupree decides that Lance Armstrong (yes, the seven-time Tour d\' France winner) has all the answers. Molly, meanwhile, is relegated to complaining that Carl\'s not home often enough while Dupree just won\'t leave.Of course, bad things happen, understandings are reached, and everybody learns something before the all too predictable end of this thankfully not too long (108 minutes) movie. What a surprise.Matt Dillon is a good actor. I thought he was absolutely incredible in the at-least-as-incredible movie Crash. But he\'s wasted here on a series of apologies and incredulous ""I don\'t believe this is happening to me"" looks. Kate Hudson, meanwhile, is a pretty girl and no slouch in the acting department herself. But she and Dillon have little chemistry, and her role as an elementary school teacher is much too much that of a woman who is frustrated beyond endurance by the fact that her husband isn\'t growing up as she wishes he would. Some of her dramatic lectures to her new husband are so bad they\'re shudder-worthy.Owen Wilson is a brilliant comedic actor. If he had something funny to work with here, he\'d be great. Unfortunately, he\'s given very, very little. That there are moments you\'ll smile at all (and there are a couple) is due almost entirely to the fact that he\'s just that good. Meanwhile, Michael Douglas may come out the best of the bunch as he shows a real joy in playing the role of a manipulative and overbearing father-in-law who knows full well what he is \x97 but who blithely just doesn\'t care.Directing team Anthony and Joe Russo (they\'re brothers) have a far more impressive television résumé than they do in the movies (the two have, for example, directed several episode of critical darling Arrested Development). While their work here is okay, they\'re also hamstrung by a lackluster script. Written by first-time screenwriter Mike LeSieur, You, Me and Dupree is utterly ordinary. It\'s entirely predictable in its plot, and it lacks either the drama or the humor to make it worth spending your time or your money.You, Me and Dupree got no laughs from me at all, and I believe there were only two or three from the rest of the audience in the showing I attended (most of them from teen-aged boys). I fidgeted and yawned myself. And I get the idea I wasn\'t alone in my opinion: On my way out of the theatre, a voice behind me said, ""Man, that was really bad!"" That pretty much sums it up for me, too.FAMILY SUITABILITY: You, Me and Dupree is rated PG-13 for ""sexual content, brief nudity, crude humor, language, and a drug reference."" I\'d say that PG-13 is just about right, though some of the sexual innuendos make the movie suitable only for the most mature of 13 year-olds. Actually, I take that back. I\'m not sure that You, Me and Dupree is really suitable for anybody.', ""An absolutely terrible attempt at comedy. I won't even do it the justice of writing a full review. Suffice to say, everything about this film is awful. The story is inane, the acting is terrible, the humour is forced, and the characters are annoying. Owen Wilson is quickly proving that he's the most unfunny of the Frat Pack bunch - he's completely lost here without Vince Vaughn or Ben Stiller to support him. Matt Dillon & Kate Hudson are phoning it in, and Michael Douglas terribly overacts - he's obviously just picking up a paycheck here. The story goes from mildly amusing to just plain bad in no time at all, and the laughs are few and far between. I'm just glad I didn't have to pay for it. Truly awful."", ""I rated it with a two only because there are a few parts in it that are very funny.The writers and producers of this story had a good idea, then the film takes a turn for the worst and makes you want to get up and leave. I told everyone I know not to waste their hard earned $$$ on this.The movie isn't even worth a download for free off the internet, if you have seen the trailer you saw just about every funny part. Sad when a movie isn't worth a download let alone the .15 cents it would cost to burn it onto media! Also note to director. You might want to either leave the UPS truck there or move it altogether in the future so when your doing retakes, its not missing and then back again, then missing and back again... oh and then missing again in the background of the stick ball game in the street."", 'The premise of You, Me and Dupree is that Carl Peterson (Matt Dillon) marries his boss\'s daughter, Molly (Kate Hudson), and then his best man, Dupree (Owen Wilson) stays with them after losing his job and all his earthly possessions.You, Me and Dupree is bad. First and foremost, it\'s tedious. It has no real direction. Things happen, and a few minutes later, it doesn\'t matter that they\'ve happened. You sit there and watch 108 minutes of meaningless, witless anecdotes that involve the same people, but have no real bearing on their lives.As far as the characters go, they really aren\'t characters, and they really don\'t go anywhere. We never learn how Carl and Molly met, or why they love one another other than that they have sex a lot. Carl says stuff like, ""Molly is the best thing that\'s ever happened to me,"" but we see no proof of it. Dupree is a little eccentric, but it\'s all been done before. I don\'t know anyone in real life who is as boring as the rest of the characters with the exception of Carl\'s father-in-law, Mr. Thompson (Michael Douglas). But neither Dupree nor Thompson perform with enough absurdity to make the movie work.The movie is too long and unfunny to be a comedy. And it\'s not that I\'m opposed to body humor, it\'s that the movie doesn\'t even try to be funny for huge segments. I laughed with the rest of them when Dupree broke up Carl and Molly\'s intimacy because of his emergency with the ""crapper."" The movie needs more of that, instead of trying to sustain drama and characters that aren\'t there.Once, I felt that the movie was actually taunting me. Owen Wilson watches a clip from Roman Holiday, a film starring Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn. As he and I saw that clip, I thought to myself, ""Why am I not watching that?!"" Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn. Owen Wilson and Kate Hudson. Hrm..... Which should I pick?', 'Greetings again from the darkness. I have absolutely nothing positive to say about this movie ... except that Kate Hudson remains luminescent on screen. Too bad she seems to have inherited step-dad Kurt Russell\'s knack for selecting bad scripts.The TV director Russo brother team (""Arrested Development"") is at a loss on the big screen. Combine that with a god awful script from screenplay rookie Mike LeSieur and the same old-same old lame, basset hound loser man-child, played ad nauseate by the now long in the tooth Owen Wilson, and all the pieces come together for a ticking bomb.On top of that, we can\'t help but wonder about the age difference between Dillon and Hudson as newlyweds. Unlike his role in ""There\'s Something About Mary"", Dillon plays pretty much the straight guy to Wilson\'s motel lounge quality comedian act. That said, I am definitely looking forward to Dillon as Bukowski in the upcoming ""Factotum"". Wilson needs to stick to writing or learn to accept much smaller roles. Hudson just needs better films. She is treading very close to becoming the female Matthew MacConoughy (her co-star in ""How to lose a guy in 10 days"". That is not a good thing ... and I believe she is wasting her apparent talent.Michael Douglas, Seth Rogen and Lance Armstrong provide the few laughs. Not even sure what to call this one. It is not funny enough to be a comedy and not romantic enough to be a RomCom. What I do know, is that it is a BAD film.', ""This movie is no different from most of the other romantic comedies you might see, which are basically all the same to me. This movie doesn't really have anything new or fresh to offer. I wouldn't see it if I had a choice (my sister dragged me along with her).I've never fallen asleep in a theater before, but I must say, I was feeling bored and about to fall asleep during the first 10 minutes. Because I had the strange feeling that I had seen it before, because it is so much like all the other cliché romantic comedies.Long story short, it isn't worth it. It won't change your life or teach you something important, and it's not that funny, there are only one or two good laughs in the movie, but nothing that will have you in stitches. I'd only recommend seeing this movie as a last resort."", ""I expected You Me and Dupree to be one of those films where all the funny scenes were spoiled in the previews, but surprisingly there were a few more left for the movie... not many though. I didn't have any upheaving laughs, no, not that kind of movie. To judge this movie after I had already planned for it to be a huge failure of a production means that I can not criticize it too much. Exceeding expectations is part of the film making world too.A problem I noticed was how there were lacking actors. Matt Dillon, Kate Hudson, and Owen Wilson were in the film entirely, and only about two more were in it for over 5 scenes. Amanda Detmer's name appeared in the opening and ending credits and I didn't even see her! I'm not sure if it's all about deleted scenes, but she is a good actress and I was disappointed to not see her in this movie. On the bright side, Kate Hudson filled in the hotness that Amanda would have brought.The plot wasn't too good. I didn't like the flow of the movie or the situations that occurred. It seemed somewhat entertaining, yet was made wrongly. I didn't expect much though.Overall, it was average. You will see this on TV and watch it in a few years. 5 out of 10. Save your money. I did, free passes for employees!!"", 'Whenever a movie mistakenly thinks a bad pun of a tagline (""Dupree\'s a crowd"" anyone?) is gonna rope in ye olde movie-going audience, there is officially room to be concerned with what you\'re about to watch. OK, so the tagline isn\'t as bad as some, but it is enough to raise a red flag. However, is it enough to indicate what\'s to come? Welp, I\'m happy to say that once again I\'m gonna keep my distance from all your unfavorite (I\'m makin\' up words, baby!) stuffed-shirt critics out there who are giving You, Me and Dupree a merciless shredding because it doesn\'t meet the inherent level of pretension they so girlfriendlessly demand. That\'s right, folks. I, Johnny Betts, enjoyed You, Me and Dupree. I\'m one of about three movie reviewers to boldly make that claim, but doggone on it, I\'m sticking by it.Granted, my enjoyment was heightened due to the fact that I kept my expectations low and didn\'t have to pay to see the movie, but I was entertained all the same.It\'s only fair that I be perfectly honest and admit I\'m somewhat easily amused when it comes to watching actors and actresses that I really like, and Dupree sports a great cast. Mileages will vary depending on your tolerance level of the actors involved.Owen Wilson is one of my constant comedic favorites, once again displaying that crooked nose we all love and projecting child-like innocence with his signature charm. I also love his ability to sincerely deliver outrageous and cheesy lines in ways that make them seem not quite so outrageous or silly.Then there\'s Kate Hudson, only the absolute cutest thing that Hollywood has going for it. She plays this role a little more low key than usual, but she\'s still irresistible, evidenced by her black bikini scene where she proves that she inherited what was always her mom\'s best *ahem* asset.Rounding out the cast, straight-man Matt Dillon\'s cool as always, and Seth Rogen, though woefully underused, brings an impressive laughs-to-screen time ratio. Most of you will remember him from The 40 Year-Old Virgin, but he\'ll always be Ken Miller and Ron Garner to me. If neither of those names means anything to you then we need to have a serious talk about a couple of DVD sets you might want to consider acquiring.Is this a film that\'ll find its way to the top of any of these actors\' resumes? No. Is it a non-stop laugh-fest? No. Is it a film I can watch over and over and cry with laughter every time? Nah. Will you be disappointed if you\'re expecting something along the lines of The Wedding Crashers? Most likely.After all, I never said the movie doesn\'t have its flaws. Some of the humor is a little too conventional and predictable, and the dramatic dialogue isn\'t exactly the most compelling to grace the screen, so no, this isn\'t gonna go down in the Book of Comedy Classics, nor do I feel a necessity to pencil it in as a future addition to my DVD collection (unless the special features are loaded with Kateness). But I found it to be a fun, light-hearted, silly way to take a 2-hour break from the real world. As I mentioned in the paragraphs above, its greatest strength is in its likable cast and their chemistry, and I appreciate the charm it displayed in never taking itself too seriously.Plus, the majority of the screening crowd seemed to enjoy it. I\'ve personally never had nor been a third wheel like Dupree, but those of you who can relate to such an experience might appreciate it on a different level.I can\'t say that You, Me and Dupree is a film that just absolutely demands to be seen on the big screen, but it\'s certainly the kind of movie that you usually watch with friends and family where most everyone will walk away with a good chuckle, no one will be overly offended, Aunt Ella will comment on how ""it was cute,"" no one\'s life will be dramatically altered, and Uncle Larry\'s uninvited segue into some boring recollections about his own ""Dupree"" experiences will wake everybody back up to their nightmare reality.All in all, if you think no one can bring seven different kinds of smoke like Owen Wilson, and you find Kate Hudson to be seven different kinds of smokin\' then there\'s something here for you to enjoy. Be it at a matinée or as a future rental. It might just help you discover your ""ness."" THE GIST You, Me and Dupree might not deliver two solid hours of nothing but out-loud laughter and the dramatic elements might falter at times, but there\'s no denying that the cast is great, and if you love those involved then you\'ll find some enjoyment here. I wouldn\'t pay more than matinée prices, and if you don\'t have a lot of spending money to throw around then just save it for a rental.', 'I\'m a big fan of Owen Wilson when he\'s in the right genre. He has proved to be a considerably good talent in drama as well, but comedy is his real niche. The whole ""Frat Pack"" sub-genre that is popular right now is where he most belongs, and as such ""You, Me and Dupree"" offers what one would expect from a comedy starring Owen Wilson as a slacker who leeches off of people.What I didn\'t expect from this comedy was its dark side. Matt Dillon\'s character turns pretty nasty and his relationship with wife Kate Hudson gets rough. Likewise his confrontational scenes with Michael Douglas seem to betray the lighter attitude of the scenes involving Dupree (Wilson). The movie has a few twists and turns that I didn\'t expect - when I saw the ads I figured it would be an OK-but-forgettable movie about a guy crashing in a newly-married couple\'s house, end of story: but there\'s actually more to the story here. It doesn\'t necessarily make it stand out (it\'s not a very good film) - but the movie moves away from Dupree being a pest and actually begins to focus on Dillon\'s growing anger towards his friend as he believes him to be developing a crush on his wife. The whole subplot with Douglas\' character (playing the father of Hudson) becomes quite prominent in the film as well. This is where it really takes a turn for the worse.Whereas for the first hour or so is fun and predictable in the vein of Wilson\'s other films, once it begins trying to develop a ""showdown"" of sorts between all its characters it gets to be too much. The ending sequence involving Wilson being chased by a Samoan security guard is way over-the-top and betrays the realistic roots of the movie.I also didn\'t care much for Dillon\'s character. I could relate to his frustration but he almost seemed TOO realistic for this film. You know when critics complain in these movies about how clichéd the ""nice guy"" characters always are? Well Dillson isn\'t a nice guy in this movie - he\'s got a hot temper and loses his cool a bunch of times in the movie. Towards the end he\'s like a mad, violent alcoholic and I started to feel like Dupree should end up with his wife instead.Overall the first hour of this movie is fun and entertaining and has its fair share of humorous segments - I laughed a lot when Dupree burns down a house and at some of the early jokes involving his interaction with old buddies - but the movie obviously realizes this isn\'t enough of a plot for a 90-minute feature and tries to develop other plot lines 3/4 of the way through, and that\'s when it gets tiresome. The ending ultimately left a bad taste in my mouth and felt tacky. It seemed like a last-minute ending that was filmed after poor test screenings. A relationship crisis involving Dupree is never even resolved in the movie - as if the crew totally forgot about it.I guess I would have left the theater feeling more fulfilled if perhaps the film had continued as a lightweight ""frat pack""-style comedy rather than trying to rise above other genre entries. I acknowledge the film\'s attempts at becoming ""more"" than just another comedy of this type - but they chose the wrong path and just made it worse. In this case it\'s an example of a shallow movie trying too hard to be something else.I liked it, and I was entertained, but it\'s better left as a rental and only if you\'re a fan of the actors. (By the way, it\'s worth mentioning that apart from Wilson\'s hilarious performance, Kate Hudson really impressed me and had more of a realistic role than women do in most of these sorts of films. You can\'t slam ""You, Me and Dupree"" for not at least trying.)', '\'You Me and Dupree\', the new comedy starring the Texas charmer Owen Wilson, represents two of the breeziest hours in film this year.Quirky and funny \'You Me and Dupree\' might be a film likely to catch you by surprise. It involves two newlyweds (Dillon and Hudson) and their oafish house guest Dupree (Wilson), who is turning their new world upside down.I can\'t tell you what makes \'Dupree\' tick so well, but something does. As far as plotting nothing seemed to be ""filler"" to me. Everything seems to drive the plot forward. Though it might just be ""going through the paces"" the film makes those paces as quick and lively as possible.Performance wise, Wilson brings the right amount of charm needed for us to accept Dupree. Dillon and Hudson are solid in thankless roles. And Douglas creates a good supporting character of Hudson\'s father and Dillon\'s boss. I\'d also like to point out the effortless comedic flow of \'The 40 Year Old Virgin\' \'s Seth Rogen also seen here.In closing, \'Dupree\' represents some very breezy summer fun in the air conditioned comfort of a theater.', 'Marriages can be hypocritical, and the blame always falls on the opposite party. Thus, when a marriage is portrayed in a movie, the protagonist is sometimes hard to identify. This is the case in You, Me, and Dupree, which presents all of its characters at once but gives us no one to root for. Surely they have their positive qualities, but unfortunately they are blindsided by the negative ones.If one specific character cannot be our favorite, then we must equally support all of them: ""You,"" Kate Hudson\'s Molly, is betrothed to ""Me,"" Matt Dillon\'s Carl, who works for his father- in-law, Micheal Douglas\' Mr. Thompson (okay, he can be ""and""), and is best friends with Owen Wilson\'s ""Dupree."" Four principles, no protagonist. We want everyone to be happy, but they\'re just so hard to like.Their involvement with each other begins when Dupree moves in with the newly-wed couple of Carl and Molly, who seem reluctant but generous enough to give him shelter for a few nights. Being an unmotivated leech, however, Dupree moves right in and begins making his presence more permanent than Kate and Molly are comfortable with. This sets the scene for some funny moments involving Dupree\'s befriending of all the neighborhood children, who probably share his intellectual level, but most of the Dupree-jokes involve feces, nudity, or sex, alone or otherwise. Toilet humor or not, it serves to buttress the point that Dupree just is not a likable person.Lucky, then, that he\'s not the main focus of the story. That honor goes to Carl, who is simultaneously dealt two difficult situations: Dupree fowling his nest and Mr. Thompson trying to overlord his marriage to Molly, even suggesting that Carl voluntarily sterilize himself. We get the feeling that Mr. Thompson would take pleasure in doing the deed himself.As I stated before, there is no clear protagonist. Molly waffles between inviting in and kicking out Dupree, Carl has outbursts resulting in physical pain (mostly his), Mr. Thompson is the father-in-law from hell we met in Meet the Parents, and Dupree will do anything to live off of someone else. They roar and they rampage until the end, but the concluding situation is calmed far to quickly and unrealistically, like a riot quelled in an instant. Many unnecessary jokes could have been replaced with plot development, but they still elicit some legitimate laughs, and that\'s why we came.', 'Last night a friend coaxed me into seeing ""You, Me and Dupree."" Even though I have liked all four of its principal actors for years, I hadn\'t planned on seeing it last night or possibly ever. The reviews have been uniformly terrible, so I was expecting the worst. I sat in a movie theater that was perhaps one-third full, and I was waiting for the boredom to set in, which the critics said was coming\x97in spades.Yes, Owen Wilson has bleached-blond locks, again, but that is probably the only accurate comment in any of the reviews that I saw, and I must have read at least ten of them, from various parts of the country. He was very good, as he was in the ""Wedding Crashers."" Kate Hudson was perky as always, and did a splendid job; and anyone who has loved her mother over the years will find Goldie\'s ""clone"" just as lovely as ever.Matt Dillon did a terrific job, and was totally believable comically; and Michael Douglas was very good too, playing his character with aplomb. In short, it was a very funny movie, and quite refreshing given the alternatives; namely, movies that are loaded to the gills with special effects, which jar one\'s cranium to the uttermost.It seems like the critics were in lock step in panning this film, which may be driving away audiences unfairly. Indeed, this may be a perfect example of the critics being wrong, dead wrong. Go see it in a theater, or buy a DVD when it comes out, and my guess is that you will not be disappointed one iota\x97and may actually love it. All four principal actors are perfectly balanced, and they are strong enough to be wonderful foils to one another.', 'I went into this movie tonight not expecting much based on the HORRIBLE reviews given to this movie on IMDb and critics reviews in today\'s paper. I was pleasantly surprised to find this to be another sweet movie about two male buddies that are learning to grow up. Owen Wilson was adorable and his character was not a loser. Dupree (I won\'t give away his real name because it surprises you when it comes up in the movie...) gives sage advice throughout the movie. In one scene is he standing in for Matt Dillon\'s character at a career day, in Molly\'s (Kate Hudson) 3-4? grade classroom. He tells the kids that some of them will go on to traditional or socially acceptable success, while some of them (pods, he calls them!) will ""float"" for a while, while they wait for the calling from the ""mother ship"" for their destined path in life. He says ""the pods that needed to hear this, did,"" and I laughed my butt off. His ""floating pod"" theory was hysterical and very accurate.It sounds ridiculous, but it isn\'t. Dupree\'s character is consistent throughout as a lovable guy looking for his path. He\'s a smart, charismatic guy that makes lots of mistakes along the way. Of course the previews showed all the stupid humor (bathroom jokes, jacking off, etc) but it doesn\'t play as crazily over the top in the movie as it is edited for in previews. I think the movie was as fun as it was because of the great casting. No one else could have been Michael Douglas\' character (besides perhaps James Caan but he might have been too scary) and NO ONE could have done Dupree like Owen Wilson, because Dupree IS Owen Wilson. If you\'re like me and you like Owen Wilson movies, you\'ll really enjoy this movie.PS: There is a (hush hush) cameo in this movie when you least expect it and you\'ll laugh.', 'You,Me and Dupree is a hilarious comedy that lives up to ""40 year old Virgin"" and ""Wedding Crashers"". While the film\'s plot feels like a wacky 80\'s movie, it manages to keep you interested and entertained. Owen Wilson scores another his with this movie. Owen Wilson is amazing as Randy Dupree, yet the supporting cast led by Kate Hudson and Matt Dillon manage to give this comedy a smart sharp edge. Kate Hudson still manages to pull a few laughs while Michael Douglas as her strict father puts a classic spin on the picture. Overall this film is worth every penny and will keep you laughing from start to finish.', 'I honestly liked it. It was funny, had a good story line, and even though it ended like I predicted, it was cute. Yes, Owen Wilson is playing his usual character, but it suits him best, so I say let him do it. Kate Hudson and Matt Dillon are a cute couple and they did a great job in this movie. Plus, Matt Dillon is a good-looking man, even for a forty-sum year old!Although I enjoyed the movie, as well as the acting, Michael Douglas did not impress me at all. He didn\'t have much of a relevant part in the movie, other than distracting ""Carl"" from his home life. Also, I felt it dragged on a bit. But, overall, I enjoyed it, and the others with me in the theater did too.', ""I have to say, You, Me and Dupree was pleasantly surprising. I had expected it to be something along the lines of Wedding Crashes, and I am pleased to say that You, Me and Dupree was nothing like it (although don't get me wrong, Wedding is a great movie). Dupree was in a sense predictable and certain scenes were drawn out, but the overall plot was cute and the movie itself had some memorable moments, including yet another great performance from Michael Douglas. You, Me and Dupree was a charming and delightful comedy that was at times predictable, and had the occasional irritating character, but was still worth the money, and worth seeing again. If you're looking for an easy going, light hearted movie with that isn't shallow, You, Me and Dupree I highly recommend."", 'Randy DuPree(Owen Wilson,as laid-back and off-beat as ever) is the kind of friend that people sit and talk about: a kooky,non-conventional sort who means well but finds a way to get himself or others into trouble. He\'s got an almost savant-like way about him,an ability to learn stuff and self-motivate,but he\'s also pretty much living in the moment,still knowing how to have fun. And shortly after his buddy Carl(Matt Dillon)gets married to Molly(Kate Hudson),DuPree\'s now in need of a home. Being almost life-long friends,Carl agrees to help out DuPree,believing he\'s only going to be on their hands ""for a few days,until he gets back on his feet"".So begins the premise of this movie,where DuPree\'s persona of ease clashes with the straight,upright(read:grown-up)lifestyle of his married friends. For the most part,this movie is just like DuPree himself:laid-back,funny and earnest. For the most part it works,in large part due to the fact that the principles in the story Wilson,Dillon and Hudson are able to fill their roles perfectly and play off of each other evenly. My biggest problem with the movie was the fact that it seemed like it was never too sure WHICH DuPree it was trying to bring forth:the doofy,kid-like slacker or the savant-like potential jack-of-all trades. Also,the relationship shifts in the movie were so sharp that one might be confused and/or skeptical of just how well this would play out.Directors Anthony and Joe Russo don\'t seem to have any problem with this,opting to go with a fast flow of jokes and character interplay.While I sorta get why this film hasn\'t been getting great reviews,I still think this film is a fun summer flick. I suppose if you like this DuPree character,then you\'re gonna appreciate this movie,because it is mostly built around him,as per the subject summary line.', 'We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that This movie is terrific and lots of fun and it proves that Owen Wilson can indeed carry a film by himself. He is very very funny. Kate Hudson is simply wonderful and delicious in the movie and matt dillon is also terrific.A great fun two hours, who could ask for more.', ""I realize the story line does not seem new. The idea has been used before. I only automatically went to see it because Owen Wilson is my favorite actor. I always go out to see his movies without even bothering to check the critic's reviews. If it weren't for Owen I would be skeptical about seeing this, I hate having my time and money wasted watching a movie I've basically seen before. This is why I feel compelled to write, I don't want you to miss out on a guaranteed funny movie that will make you laugh.The difference is in the delivery. Owen Wilson and the other VERY talented cast members make the movie a real laugh riot. When you get out and see it you will agree, each actress/actor is perfect for their part. They all play off each other with great wit. If you want an entertaining, funny movie go see You, Me and Dupree. You will not be disappointed.""]",19,"['Comedy', 'Romance']"

I mean we have some real on screen Hollywood movie stars here, on a no (from what it looks like) budget film.The script and story is completely terrible. The director seems to be completely new to making film, making it look like a high school student went and made a low budget Tarantino film. The movie doesn't even seem to have any actual story to tell.One thing that also made me very aware of the fact that it was the director who screwed this whole thing up is that he changes screens to often in a really weird way that doesn't flow naturally.I understand that he is trying to transfer some sort of message to the audience but it never comes through and the whole thing just feels like a weird experience without cause.In conclusion, the movie is a waste of time."", 'I am a sci-fi lover and in general I enjoy movies that have strong characters and beautiful cinematography. This has beautiful cinematography, sometimes. As I was watching it I wondered how this director or editor (or both) got this far. The premise has a lot of potential and even if you disregard the poor acting, absent character development, and weak storyline, put in the right director\'s hands this could have been a movie worth watching. As it stands the only reason I finished it was because the set and filming were good enough to keep me tuned in. The last thing I will say is I think the four leads are actually decent actors... Kodi might be a bit stiff but he has talent and room to grow otherwise the others are really great. That and the cinematography/set are the reason this movie got above a one. I really hate to see movies flop because I feel like if they made it through all the bureaucratic hoops and all the scrutinizing of their ""product idea"" they must have some sense of film making but sometimes the creative team just lose focus and produce something like The Young Ones. On another note I guess I don\'t really understand the title. I know the characters are youngish but that isn\'t their defining attribute is it? I just don\'t get the title. Not that it is a big deal, just and observation!Happy watching!', ""I didn't check the budget of this movie but it feels like a low budget production in many ways.First of all the characters are roughly cut and stereotypes, you don't find real inner conflicts in them, Flem could have had good intentions to a degree, but he was just selfish - that is to simple for a drama.Second the long chapters don't make much sense, it's just confusing. Finishing a chapter with the death of it's subject is not smart. No flashbacks, no learnings in the later chapters about Ernest or the past for example.The setup was perfect for a Rashomon style drama, by simply NOT letting the audience know every detail all the time. Wasted chance.The whole movie was to long for the story. The slow pacing and the lack of anything happening over long periods (nothing of substance at least) makes it tiresome.The automatic mule robot (Big Dog or LS3 Pack Mule) did not add much to the sci fi feeling - it was developed around 2009 or even earlier. If this movie is supposed to take place in the near future (like some 20-50 years) such a machine would be long gone and replaced by better systems. Some primitive drones and stuff do not convince me, too. A little bit more attention to the details would have been nice. Even poor settlers would use something better than an 80s style transistor radio.The border situation was awkward. I wonder how the patrols walking on stilts would defend against the mob pushing them over... the available fences and guard's walkways would allow much better control. Just silly.I watched the German translation and the dub voices were terrible. They sounded like some people from the street had been asked to dub the movie during their lunch brake.All in all the story was too simple, too often seen and the rest of the movie didn't save the day.I don't consider it a waste of time but would expect something more imaginative or original these days. It would make a solid first movie for a director starting his career right after film school."", ""The movie doesn't add much to the sci-fi genre.But, the story can be interesting if you pay a lot of attention. That's one of the major problems with this movie: The story starts in a boring way making it a challenge to keep up watching but it changes it's paste when getting near to the end.At least, the actors did their best to show emotions(which are basically anger & revenge). What i liked a lot was that the movie shows many young actors with potential to make more interesting movies IF they still follow these same styles of films. I somehow feel that this movie could have been much more if the story was developed in a other way. In conclusion, i think this movie was not that bad but neither would i watch it again."", ""The plot: After a catastrophic drought, a man and his two teenaged children attempt to survive in a post-apocalyptic society.I wanted to like this more than I did. Everything about it seems like it would appeal to me. The problem is that I got a bit bored during a few slower parts of the film as I waited for the predictable plot to catch up to where I knew it was going. That's not a deal-breaker, but the scenes were telegraphed rather overtly early on, and anyone who's familiar with this sort of story can probably predict most of the film after twenty minutes. That said, it successfully avoided several annoying clichés in post-apocalyptic films: cannibals, biker gangs, raping all the female characters, and characters who do more yelling than talking. I was glad to see a post-apocalyptic film that was more concerned with characters than gratuitous elements such as these. Don't get me wrong: I love gratuitous exploitation films, but it's nice to have something a bit more restrained every now and then.I would hesitate to truly recommend this film to fans of post-apocalyptic science fiction. There's certainly much to enjoy if you're starved for good entries in that genre, but it's nowhere near as good as The Road, which was a near-masterpiece. Certainly, the mood and atmosphere of that film was missing, and if you're looking for a truly bleak and depressing story, you won't find it here. This is a more traditional Western story in which a family survives in a near-lawless frontier. If you're more a fan of Westerns than post-apocalyptic films, then I can see how you might enjoy this more than I did. Even so, I think that you'd be better served by watching old Sergio Leone films. You won't get robotic mules, but you'll get much better cinematography and pacing. I can't remember a time when I was ever bored in a Leone film."", '""Pray for rain.""Gwyneth Paltrow\'s younger brother, Jake, introduces us to a dystopian future where water is scarce in Young Ones, his sophomore feature film. The film has style and it is also gorgeous to look at the empty vast dry land (filmed in South Africa, but taking place in an undisclosed American town), but unfortunately the characters did lack some development. This could well be classified as a sci-fi western centering on a family that is struggling to survive under the harsh dry conditions. The always fascinating Michael Shannon plays Ernest Holm, the father of two adolescents who has decided to stay in his dry land hoping he can find water to cultivate his once fertile land. His younger son, Jerome (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is always alongside him as they struggle to find a means for survival. With the help of a robotic donkey carrier, he sends supplies to the workers who extract water from deep wells. His relationship with his daughter, Mary (Elle Fanning), isn\'t going too well. She has secretly been dating Flem (Nicholas Hoult), who isn\'t someone his father trusts. Flem has plans of his own for Ernest\'s land and he will stop at nothing in order to get his way. Aimee Mullins has a supporting role as Ernest\'s paralytic wife who lives in the hospital where she can use special equipment to move. The film is divided into three chapters centering on each one of the three male characters. The first centering on Ernest, is by far the best thanks in large part to Michael Shannon\'s incredible performance. It also sets the rules for this futuristic world and it manages to engage us. But the promising start of the film quickly dies down in the next two chapters with predictable character arcs and familiar story lines. It is a shame because the film did promise an inventive post apocalyptic setting, but other than the fascinating visuals it doesn\'t deliver anything fresh. Despite not having much character development I did enjoy the performances from the talented young cast. Nicholas Hoult is solid as the villain, while Kodi Smit- McPhee once again finds himself playing a character in a desolated future (The Road). He delivers one of the stronger roles and did a decent job holding up his own in the scenes he shared with Shannon. Fanning is an actress I have always admired, but her character is the least developed this time and she doesn\'t get to do much here. It is a shame Shannon doesn\'t get more screen time because the film loses much of its appeal after that first chapter. He always brings an incredible fresh quality to each one of his characters and in a way Ernest was the reason why this dystopian world seemed so fascinating.Young Ones is the third consecutive Western I\'ve seen and each one has been very different. Once Upon A Time in the West is a masterpiece and a classic spaghetti western, while A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night was an Iranian vampire western that was more atmospheric than anything else. This futuristic western is also gorgeous to look at and introduces a rather interesting premise but it loses its appeal after the first part of the film and heads towards generic and familiar territory. I\'d still recommend this film because there are some interesting qualities to it and there is also Michael Shannon of course who always delivers. I loved the landscape as well, but the pacing of the story does get tedious and predictable at times. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/', 'Set in the future when water is hard to find a teenage boy sets out to protect his family and survive.In a small way, this works as a companion piece to ""Interstellar"". Both are futuristic, science fiction movies that address a world consumed by drought. And both were released in 2014. That may be just about the only overlap, but it makes them a nice pair, and also makes me want to watch ""Dune"".Somehow, though, this film never really grabs your attention. Elle Fanning is decent, and Kodi Smit-McPhee is a good actor (and a nice guy). Maybe this needed more Michael Shannon? He is, of course, among the best actors in the business today.', 'I got to admit that i have never reviewed any title in IMDb before. I do watch lot of movies but never felt like writing a review.Young ones is an amazing movie that i have watched in an while. I kinda shows us the expectation of how the world would be 50 years from now. The cinematography had me thru the entire movie.The characters and their relation are well formed and showcased in likable way.The lead characters grab our attention right from the start and get in flow the movie plot. I really felt sad all on with characters, revived by the revenge and fell in love with the movie all over again.Young ones is one of a kind. Soundtrack by Nathan Johnson did a sensational piece of art, taking the movie scenes to the next level.Over all . 8/10', ""This film was very good Science Fiction: great images, great story. It's original and full of remarkable details: the machine, the opening scene, the hospital\x85 together with smaller things that contributed to make the story more believable and increased overall quality.The plot, although classical under some respects, is not easily predictable and keeps the attention high. So does the beautiful South Africa landscape that Country Music makes sound 100% American.When both the script and the visual results are so good it is uncommon that they are the work of just one person. Jake Paltrow however both wrote and directed the movie, alone, and this impressed me. I didn't think of him as a top author (in my own private, useless, mental list) and I owe him a (private, useless, mental) apology."", 'Let\'s get this right of the bat: This is a low budget movie and it is draining the viewer (slow paced).

If that\'s what you expect/your whole extension of movie knowledge, do not read any further, but especially: do not watch this movie at all. You\'ll be doing yourself a favor mostly.Back to the actors, who are giving extraordinary performances. No matter the age of the ones involved, we do get amazing on our screen.

Your Highness,3.38,3.85,['Comedy'],"When Prince Fabious's bride is kidnapped, he goes on a quest to rescue her... accompanied by his lazy useless brother Thadeous.",sadness,"['First off, let me say I pretty much worship the ground that Danny McBride walks on - he has made some of the best comedy EVER (foot fist way, eastbound and down), and David Gordon Green has some chops as well. I\'m not quite as crazy about James Franco, but heck he was awesome in Freaks and Geeks, and he\'s not too hard on the eyes.So, I was going into this movie expecting a few laughs at least. And that\'s exactly what I got... a ~few~ laughs, a ~very few~ laughs. I noticed something was off within the first few moments and things never improved.There were a number of jokes that fell totally flat, I\'m talking silence in a full house of people who paid nothing to see this. There were some jokes that the teenagers in the audience seemed to appreciate, but overall the audience response was weak, and it felt like the movie had been thrown together without much thought. Or like it had been made about two years ago and sat on a shelf until Natalie Portman won her Oscar and someone decided to release this.I rarely walk out of movies but I was tempted tonight. They took something that was potentially a good idea and made it a total bore. If you\'re a fan of Danny McBride, I\'d actually advise you to avoid this film as it will degrade your opinion of him.On the positive side, I guess you could say that McBride and James Franco had okay chemistry - I would be interested to see these two dudes just hanging out and cracking jokes, and that would be more interesting than ""your highness"". Oh, and as for the reviewer comparing this to ""Princess Bride"" ... I don\'t think so. Not even in the same universe.', ""When I first saw the trailers for this movie I thought that it would be a medieval spoof with some drug and crude humor. However, what I got instead was a large amount of profane jokes, an excessive use of the F word, and a large amount of jokes centered around the penis and vagina. In fact you could say that the whole story centered around these types of humor, which for me was not what I am interested in. Yet this does not mean it is a bad movie for everyone, I'm sure there are plenty of people who will enjoy this humor and think this movie is great. So what was good about this movie? The first thing I'll agree was good was the chemistry and wide personalities the main cast had in this film. James Franko and McBride were believable as brothers, and brought great depth to the rivalry experienced by brothers. Mix this in with a funny and unlikely hero named Courtney and you add another level of character jokes that had a lot of potential. Eventually, Natalie Portman comes in and you have a kick butt heroine who adds more variety for the pool of characters. The main villain played an obnoxious moron pretty well, but he wasn't as devious or evil as wizards can be. In fact he was more perverted than anything and if this is what they wanted for a character, then the actor has succeeded. A second positive is that some of the action scenes were exciting and fast paced, but still lacked the depth that other fighters had. I didn't expect much action though with it being a comedy. Perhaps the biggest things that I liked were the mechanical bird Simond, the pet lizard Steven, and the musical score that goes along well with the movie. The camera work was also done well and did not overshadow the content to be captured. What was bad about the movie for me? The first thing is the constant use of the F word every two or three minutes. Constant use of this word seems to suggest that the only vocabulary word writers know today is F***. It actually gets old after like the fifth or sixth use and becomes distracting from the rest of the dialogs. A second weakness for me the constant, smash it over your head, comedy centering on sex, oral sex, masturbation, and penis humor constantly being thrown in at every possible moment. Again if your a fan of this kind of humor you will probably enjoy this a lot more than I did. However, for me it got annoying and eventually made the dialogs of the film predictable and boring. The third weakness of this movie is its predictability in plot and the direction it takes. It doesn't take long for a major catastrophe or two to occur and this leads to various predictions of what will happen next, which leads to no plot twists or factors that make this movie extra special. Perhaps the fifth weakness is probably the drug humor in this movie, which is a little dry and played out. It seems that one of the brothers merely wants to smoke and have sex and actually reminds of a more upscale Real World or Jersey Shore character. Combine all these factors together for me and you get a movie that has some catchy jokes, some well done scenes, and great brotherhood relationships. Unfortunately all this is overshadowed by the crude humor and language that fills this movie. To finish this review I would like to give my rating for me, and a few other genre fans. For me I'm giving this movie a 3 out of 10 just because I am not the biggest fan of penis jokes and the F word being dropped left and right. For those of you who are impartial to these factors and are looking for a decent comedy, you may find this to be somewhere between a 6 and 7. Finally for fans of the Harold and Kumar series and Pineapple Express series, I'm thinking perhaps a 7-9 range depending on how easily your entertained, what you like about those movies, and how much slapstick predictability you like. Until tomorrow, this is rgkarim signing out."", 'I saw the trailer for this film a few times recently and was quite eager to see it. Besides the pedigree of filmmakers (hilarious Pineapple Express, etc) and a trailer that really made me laugh that seemed to not use only the best material from the movie unlike most trailers these days.So, when i picked to see an advance screening last night I stoked. But, I was sorely disappointed with what I saw. Not that the movie was a total loss and failure, it just was such a let down. Oddly enough, the best part of the movie was the non-comedic elements. It actually plays pretty well as a predictable homage to fantasy films. But other than a few chortles here and there the comedy falls flat. I am no prude, but the chief humorous device used is to have the fantastical character curse. Overused and obvious, just say the word ""F**K"" repeatedly and having obvious dick jokes was just tiresome and not funny. The slapstick falls flat and even the attempts at gross-out jokes a la Farrelly Brothers and Wayons brothers Scary Movie farces don\'t even rise ( lower?) to that level. And, Natalie Portman doesn\'t even show up until the second half of the movie! Sigh. What a let down.', ""I have just seen this at a preview screening in London.I'm not actually a fan of low brow humour but I found myself laughing and chuckling throughout this filthy mouthed, very gory, medieval sword and sorcery fantasy comedy. Its mainly because the cast is very likable with its main leads resonating off each other in this pool of silliness which makes the film highly entertaining. While James Franco and Danny McBride provides the laughter and brotherly banter, Natalie Portman strides in with stunning gravitas as a deceptive sexy swashbuckling heroine.The storyline is a simple action adventure journey to save a damsel in distress from a warlord. But this not a naked gun style comedy, rather a humorous homage to classic fantasy movies such as Dark Crystal, Conan the Barbarian, Princess Bride etc. What's surprising is that the adventure is rather genuine and exciting with a huge dose of special effects that a comedy shouldn't really be allowed to have. I believe the film was given a normal comedy level budget but they certainly seem to have made clever use of it with some impressive special effects.Yes there is much sexual jokes and innuendos and a heavy reliance on uncharacteristic medieval expletive adjectives to force a laugh but the charm of the characters makes them get away with it.Having said all of the above, there were clearly some pacing issues and missed opportunities for this to be an even funnier and smarter movie but as it is, it offers plenty of entertainment, fun and laughs for a Friday/Saturday evening at the cinema."", 'I liked this film. It is not going to win any Oscars, and is pretty rude at times, but anyone who is a fan of Eastbound and Down will like this. It is cheesy at times, knowingly so, but does entertain all the way through. It is not trying to be ground breaking and original, it is a comedy and does what is says on the tin. Maybe do not watch the trailer though as the best bits are in there! Do not go to see it if you are easily offended, it is full of bad language, crude sex references and is quite in your face. I was heartily amused, and would recommend this for a light hearted, entertaining romp. The cast is strong. Too often, critics pan films which Jo public actually really enjoy, so judge for yourself based on what actual people say, not according to reviewers, who often are quite wrong about what people enjoy watching.', 'So this is one of those movies you get to enjoy no matter how stupid they are. ""You Highness"" mocks everything about medieval time movies, kings and knights, etc. by applying exaggeratively sarcastic and cynical humor. The humor is so superficially dull, that it really is funny due to the way it is applied to a movie about the middle ages. It\'s almost like a porno version of ""Shreck"", harshly speaking. Making jokes about genitals, sex, masculinity an such. It absolutely is nothing more than a movie to get some laughs out of, since the plot is definitely NOT on of the most superb stories you\'ve ever seen in a movie, and the acting is rather fake, for the exception of Natalie Portman and maybe James Franco. Which is actually quite funny how two A list actors put a lot of effort into a movie so dumb. And another good thing about this film is that it actually looks really cool sometimes, especially at the end during the climax. So there you have it. It definitely isn\'t meant to be praised as a masterpiece of a movie. Just sit back and enjoy the stupidity of it.', ""Not a long review, but agree with previous reviewer..this is a future classic comedy film along the lines of Monty Python, Princess Bride or Evil Dead 3. This is just to say I found comedic connections to these classic comedies, I am not comparing movies. I was lucky enough to see a very early screening of this last week and it is so refreshing to see a comedy like this, after so many over-hyped and unfunny comedy movies - no need to mention any names. Superbly funny movie! I normally only smile through so-called comedies....but this a laughing out loud movie..I think it will be so popular when it's released in UK late April."", ""Your Highness is so underrated but it's totally comprehensible. The movie is a satire about medieval action and dungeons tales movies, but it's not cheesy as ordinary satires like Scary Movie series (among others), it has its own story, with its own characters and originality and plays with clichés all the time, making the characters look pathetic when acting like heroes that needs to complete quests as in a RPG game, a satire that seems much more like Mel Brooks classic titles.People are claiming it offensive and aggressive for the extensive use of sexual language and also for some explicit nude scenes. For sure it is, and this negative response from these people is just a reflexion of the puritan hypocrite society we live in, because if you laugh about Eddie Murphy's Nutty Professor farting with his family for about 10 minutes, you aren't able to say that You Highness is offensive or aggressive for its verbal content, first of all because I'm talking about a movie that seems silly and a waste of time, but in reality it is a very intelligent and interesting one, and for sure, one of the funniest movies and the best in its satire genre that I've seen since... once upon a time.It's pure entertainment, the dialogs are sometimes taken from a porn movie. The acting is great. James Franco, as Fabious, the charming prince, is fantastic, always happy, empowering and in love, making his character seems that was taken from a fairytale, even his movements and expressions are totally inspired by everything a charming prince means and does. Danny McBride, as Thadeous, is completely the opposite, the real anti-hero image, full of envy, anger, hate and jealousy, searching and making everything just to satisfy his very own ego. And every character is ridiculous as it should be.Also the movie is full of action and special effects. Screenwriters Danny McBride and Ben Best did an excellent job together creating an uncommon tale based on mythologies and sex into a medieval and puritan world, that's why is so funny, because you never expect so serious characters talking about sex and genitals like something simple and ordinary. Like another one said, it's not a movie for those who are easily offended, but for the ones who might get its tone, will love it."", ""I watched this on DVD last night, shamefully because of what i had heard around the time of its cinema release. Well that taught me a lesson.The only accountable reason i can arrive at for all the negative feedback i heard from critics and the public is that i feel they were expecting something a little more Holy Grail, because of the setting and the English accents and instead i felt this is more Blazing Saddles, very un-pc, whilst gently goosing (oo-er) its chosen genre.It is immature and crude, but the laughs were consistent enough, its a comedy notion which would usually have a B grade budget, but has somehow been made with an A grade budget and for me that was part of its charm. Its like the slackers broke into the set of Lord of the Rings and mucked about all weekend and managed to film it.Maybe i did the right thing in retrospect, sometimes its better to watch something after the dust has settled, just watch this cold and i'll bet you'd enjoy it. In years to come i think this film will have quite a loyal following, across a certain demographic, including me."", ""Your Highness is a great comedy: it takes the RPG, Dungeon & Dragons, Medieval Fayre, genre and lampoons it perfectly: just serious enough to be a real quest, just anachronistic enough, and definitely rude enough, to be spurt your coke funny.All in if you just want to feel stupid and laugh then this is your movie. It's even probably got enough going for it to be quoted by teens everywhere of a certain geekiness.All in all, this deserves to be lots of people's guilty pleasure, it's fun, funny, even exciting, it know's its genres conventions inside out, and after a season of Game of Thrones, it's even funnier....recommended as being a lampoon and a half....fun movie."", 'This is not a ""parody"" movie in any way.

I\'m not going to summarize the movie, but to provide an idea of how awesome this movie is, here is a list of films it either makes direct reference to or I at least felt a similar tone to:Princess Bride Robin Hood: Men in Tights Star Wars Kick Ass Lord of the Rings Clash of the Titans Army of Darkness Willow Highlander Eastbound and DownIf you think these cinematic triumphs could be combined into something awesome a) you are correct, and b) you should go check this movie out.

Is there still a market for movies that feature little more than a bunch of young kids eating tons of sweets, splattering a house with paint, and hating each other?

""No, they weren\'t,"" I replied as I stared dumbfounded at the screen, shaking my head over the fact that the writers expect us to laugh about kids vomiting and then falling in it.I suppose I should commend the movie for warning the audience right away just how bad a time they can expect to have if they attempt to sit through the full 90 minutes. If the ""Nickelodeon Films"" moniker fails to send up any red flags, then the fact that Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo (possibly the hottest 51-year-old woman on the planet) meet, rekindle their high school relationship, get engaged, get married, and buy a brand new house all within the first 10 minutes should seal the deal that it\'s in your best interest to sprint to the exit and ask for your money back.There are two legitimately funny scenes in the movie, one involving Dennis Quaid brushing his tongue.

Although just released (in SA), it has a jaded feel about it.This comedy might well be yours but it's not mine!"", ""Now, granted, 2005 was not the best year for films and lately the family movies have been quite lame. But do you really think, to those who have seen the film, that this film deserves a 3.3? Come on! Where is your sense of humor? Also, I watched this film when I was babysitting my cousins, we were just laughing our heads off because this film had some good gags in it. Yes, it's unrealistic, but what movies are? Some have to be a little unrealistic in order to deliver what we want. That's the point of films, they help us escape reality and just enjoy ourselves for an hour and a half. So please, give this family comedy another chance and just let go and have fun! 6/10"", 'Since I\'ve always wanted a big family with lots of siblings, I do enjoy movies featuring large families. I\'m a die-hard Brady Bunch fan, and thought Cheaper by the Dozen was awesome-- both 1 and 2.Having said that, the plot was totally unrealistic, with entirely too many chaos/disaster scenes that I guess were supposed to be funny. There was a lot of ""fluff"" and not much ""stuff"". But because I really enjoy movies featuring large families, I ""curved"" this rating and gave it a 6-- Otherwise it would probably be a 1 or 2. Because from an unbiased point of view, it looked like something somebody slapped together this morning.', 'I got to see this film yesterday in a private screening for the audience of the Dr. Phil Show. Adorable cast of children and animals. The pot belly pig was amazing. Loved the chemistry between Russo and quaid. I saw the original and this was not exactly presented the same way, but just as good. There may have been a little too many Pratt falls, but I laughed out loud, relaxed in my seat, shed a few tears and although the ending was predictable, no one cared. This is not a film with mystery and suspense., just fun and a little tenderness. I especially liked the sail boat escapade. Like Home Alone, we know the ending, but enjoy the antics. It is a delightful movie. It is definitely a family movie, but the audience should be warned to not try any of this at home.', 'This is a light, funny family film. Rene Russo and Dennis Quaid hit their roles just about right; and the kidz are all cute and charming, even when they are being brats.This would be a better movie if it were a notch more emotionally serious at all levels in the vein of ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" or ""Dreamer."" What we have here is more of a ""Slappy-and-the-Stinkers Krazy-Kidz-Kaos-Komedy"" vehicle.Russo and Quaid are engaging as widowed parents very much desperately in love (and lonely, after losing their spouses); they give good performances spotlighting the stresses of parenting and dealing with (super-sized) blended family issues; but the engaging ""adult"" moments are quickly and inevitably subsumed by the next 5 minutes of Nick-style juvenile slapstick mess-making. My kidz will love it and yours will too(and you will laugh with them). If you\'re a married adult with kids, you will empathize with much and laugh quite a bit; yet at the end of the movie you might feel just a little bit cheated. Or not. Who knows, you might end up with a little bit of dust in your eyes (which is what this Dad sometimes tells his kids at the movies).PS. It\'s great to see the Coast Guard spotlighted in a film. Those guys rock!', 'Frank Beardsley (Quaid) is a 2-Star Admiral in the USCG and a widower with 8-kids. Helen North (Russo) is a dress designer and a widow with 10-kids. They were sweethearts in High School and meet 30-years later and get married. The kids don\'t like it and plan to break up this union.Let\'s see, we had the ""Little Old Woman Who Iived in a Shoe etc; then we had Our Gang Comedies; Then the Brady Bunch; then Eight is Enough, and then My Three Sons. All had something going for them. All were good in their day and I predict that this movie will soon be a family TV show.Yes, there are silly things in here. Come on, there are 18-kids involved so you can expect some of that. Frank runs a tight ship, and Helen does not. One of Helen\'s kids says, ""they get married and we get drafted."" See where we are going with this?But, there are also enough funny things going on to keep you going to the end of the movie. Quaid and Russo play it straight and that is to their credit. Rip Torn is always good and is probably one of the most under-rated actors of our time. Jerry O\'Connell did okay. I am surprised at the number of times I laughed at some goings on. This is good family fun. There was good timing by all and nothing was overdone and these are quite possibly the reasons the laughs came easily. This is a well done comedy. Yes, I can see where this will become a TV show in time.', ""This movie was excellent, it one of very few family movies that are suitable for all ages. Many people say they didn't like it, and gave it bad ratings probably because, there's no sexual humor or sex scenes. These days, If there's sex in a movie, then that makes it interesting and good. Hardly anyone understands that family movies are for families, they're not meant to be nasty to watch, it should be enjoyable for everyone. Movies can be great without that garbage. The humor was good and you can really feel the compassion in this movie. Its great for kids. I loved the way things happened, like the physical humor and the kid actors/actresses were so adorable. The only thing I didn't like about it was the fight over a boy that the two older girls had. I think it was stupid and unnecessary. Drake Bell did a really good job on his part. He was witty and full of drama with the different situations throughout the movie. Everyone did a great job. I give it a 8 out of 10."", 'When I heard about this movie, it was going to be like Cheaper By The Dozen x 1 1/2. Boy was I wrong until I learned that Drake Bell\'s in this movie, I had to go see it. In fact, he\'s the male Hilary Duff! His character (just like on Drake & Josh) likes to play the electric guitar & sing in a band. However, it would\'ve been better if he had sang ""Down We Fall"" during the wedding reception. I consider that tune he wrote a classic ballad.I hope this will help Drake Bell\'s acting career out as well as his music, since he\'s familiar to those who have cable TV (Nickelodeon). Drake Bell rules!', ""I have seen this movie,Since I am a lighthouse collector, I thought it was great that they moved into one and made it their home.They displayed a lot of symbols in this movie,such as the light shining to reflect care in ones heart.Opposites do attract and if you work together,no matter how big of family, you can bring it all together.Two families combined together is hard and takes a lot of work. I know because I live it everyday.It was funny, sad and very touching. I don't think it was anything like the Brady family, they were too perfect for this movie, This movie is reality. I would recommend this movie to everyone. Super Show."", 'Yours, Mine and Ours is a funny enjoyable family movie, that is much better than the critics\' reviews. I have found that critics tend to review each movie with a negative mindset, unless it is a blockbuster, or a small artsy movie. Then they lean more to the positive mindset. There tend to be three types of movies that critics mostly always view negatively, and those are slapstick, remakes and sequels. Since Yours, Mine and Ours can be described by two of those definitions, it really hadn\'t a chance as far as the critics are concerned. However, the movie is not only composed of those elements.While the movie title makes it seems like a remake of the 1968 Lucille Ball/Henry Fonda movie, technically the only thing similar is the names of the parents. The movie is really about how two large, single parent families, with different parenting styles, try to coexist. Think of Oscar and Felix (of the Odd Couple) if they had 10 and 8 children, respectively.Rene Russo plays Helen, the earth mother, ""Mia Farrow"" prototype, with a relaxed parenting style and a cluttered house. Dennis Quaid plays Frank, the Coast Guard Admiral who is a stickler for rules and regulations, but clearly loves his children as much as Helen does.Frank and Helen were college sweethearts, and reconnect on a reunion cruise, impulsively marrying and shocking their offspring. There is the chaos that comes from the merging of two large families and slapstick is inevitable.However, to label this movie as a slapstick, Three Stooges , Soupy Sales type movie is all wrong. There are those elements in it, but the love between Frank and Helen, and the love they have for their children is definitely evident. It is not the sappy, saccharine love that was evident in 60\'s television shows like Family Affair, but more like Leave It To Beaver, or even 80\'s shows like the Wonder Years. I have had friends with big and blended families, and the portrayals in this movie are on the mark.Dennis Quaid is fabulous as Frank. He can be silly in the slapstick scenes, but tender in the love scenes, and can switch back and forth with ease. He is a natural. He and Rene Russo have great chemistry, and Rene also did the slapstick parts without missing a beat. The actors who played the children were natural without being obnoxious. Linda Hunt was marvelous as the housekeeper. Think Alice on the Brady Bunch if she was allowed to be uninhibited.Much comments have been made about Fiona the pig, but I thought it was inspired to include a pet like that in the movie. It fit in perfectly with Helen\'s free spirited brood.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy, romance, and family films. The audience I saw the movie with was a mix of children and adults, all of whom laughed appropriately and clapped at the end. If this is your type of movie, don\'t allow the critics to sway you. See it for yourself, I think you will enjoy it.', 'I just saw the new \'Yours, Mine and Ours\' last night. Having seen the original 2 or 3 years ago, I already knew the whole concept of the movie and what was going to happen. I wasn\'t expecting much of it seeing as how my friend had told me it got one star in a review. However, I thought the 2005 ""Yours, Mine and Ours\' outdid the original and had definitely deserved more than just one star. The humor in the movie was far beyond that of \'Cheaper By the Dozen\'\'s which I also happened to enjoy. \'Yours..\' is a wonderful movie for the whole family to see. Also, the cast that was chosen was perfect. Bringing in stars such as Rene Russo, and Dennis Quaid, as well as young & rising celebrities such as Drake Bell, Sean Faris, Danielle Panabaker, etc., were great decisions on the casting director\'s part. With the cast that was chosen, especially the children, I felt I was able to enjoy the movie more than I would have if there were bad actors. I can only wait for a sequel to come. Until then, I shall see the upcoming \'Cheaper By the Dozen 2\'. In conclusion, AWESOME!']",16,"['Comedy', 'Family', 'Romance']"

Payne\'s six-book series about Nick Twist, a smart and, in his own opinion anyway, more-than-usually horny 14-year-old in Oakland (""a large, torpid city across from San Frandisco"") who reports in daily journal form on a series of adventures encountered on the way to losing his virginity, despite the obstacles set up by his irresponsible divorced parents. Ironically, though pointed at today\'s young teens, \'Revolt\'s\' R rating excludes them -- though the books are far more sexually explicit. Whether somehow this will become a cult movie via Netflix is hard to say. It\'s pretty faithful to the books, leaving out lots, but adding or changing little. Unfortunately Arteta\'s flat direction, and focus on the action aspects -- an accident, a fire, a botched fake suicide, invasion of the girls\' dorm of a French-language prep school in Santa Cruz -- excises much of the self-satisfied wit of the books and Nick\'s one flourish, his intellectual and literary showing off. The film necessarily loses the flavor of a day-to-day-journal, though most of the characters tend to talk in the same ornate, overly-polite style as Nick\'s entries.C.D. Payne is no Salinger. His books serve as page-turners for young readers, but they\'re nothing special. There\'s a curious sense of being out of time. Is this the Nineties, when the books were begun?-- or the youth of Payne himself, who was born in 1949? Nick\'s girlfriend Sheeni (Portia Doubleday)\'s fascination with Belmondo, chanteur Serge Gainsbourg, and the existentialists, -- and the general innocence of the behavior -- would suggest earlier days, but in the movie, people have cell phones, and a prevalance of \'shrooms and blunts makes this post-Breathless (francophile Sheeni\'s favorite movie). The main point was to keep the incidents coming, and Payne went on with ""The Further Journals"" and finally the adventures of Twist\'s younger brother.Young Canadian actor Michael Cera, the star of Miguel Arteta\'s adaptation of this movie, who\'s now twenty-one, was already a TV veteran before he was ten. Though he appeared in many episodes of the cable series ""Arrested Development,"" and in retrospect we realize he played the young Chuck Barris in George Clooney\'s droll ramble \'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,\' he reached a kind of nerdy, adorable mega-stardom only a couple years ago with two big hits, \'Juno\' and \'Superbad,\' followed by the equally charming if less seen \'Nick and Nora\'s Infinite Playlist.\'What has Mike done with his stardom? Well, he played opposite Jack Black in Harold Ramis\' slapstick (and generally panned) prehistoric comedy \'Year One\' and co-starred with his now ex-girlfriend Charlene Yi in the poorly received \'Paper Heart.\'Cera has good timing and is adept at delivering lines, which makes him well suited for comedy. His limitations in other areas appear in this new outing. He\'s both the hero and voice-over narrator, Nick Twist and Nick\'s bolder and more dashing imaginary alter ego, Francois, who goads him on to bolder action. There is a certain nonchalance in the flat style. Under ideal circumstances it might seem elegant. If you could be nerdy and cool at the same time Michael Cera is it, and girls do find him cute. He rarely appears anything but relaxed. But the high-pitched voice is inexpressive. The range is from A to B, and this is highlighted by how little success Cera has in making Francois seem any different from Nick, despite a little mustache, tight pants, and a lot of cigarettes (amusingly, puffed on even while running fast through the woods, while Nick lags clumsily behind). With this new performance, Cera continues to seem enormously appealing, but for conventional starring roles, cripplingly limited. He\'s just too pale and bland and androgynous, and the more he\'s cast as a horny guy the more far-fetched that seems. Anything with him in it seems de-fanged.Maybe it doesn\'t matter. You either get it or you don\'t, and there are plenty of young readers who insist these are ""the best books ever."" This is as good a time as any for some lighthearted teenage adventures. (The adaptation was co-written by Gustin Nash, the guy who did \'Charlie Bartlett,\' a so-so movie about a young high school entrepreneur starring Anton Yelchin.)\'Youth in Revolt\' casts some veritable cult actors, who include M. Emmett Walsh as Sheeni\'s born-again-Christian dad and Mary Kay Place as her mom, Steve Buscemi as Nick\'s dad, Ray Liotta as a cop who gets involved with his floozy mom (Jean Smart). But the presence of such memorable thespians only emphasizes how little developed their characters are. I liked relative newcomer Adhir Kalyan as Veejay, Nick\'s erudite school friend and fellow would-be seducer of women: he gives his lines some juice. Best of all is Justin Long, who slides into the scene as Sheeni\'s sly older brother. He is the only unexpected character. Long can always do a lot with a small part, and when he gets a bigger one, like in Raimi\'s recent old-fashioned horror movie \'Drag Me to Hell,\' he can be equally appealing. And there are others, such as comedy veteran Fred Willard as an excessively good-hearted neighbor.The director, Miguel Arteta, did annoying but memorable work with writer Mike White in \'Chuck and Buck,\' and the pair made something very droll in \'The Good Girl.\' One wonders if Arteta was the ideal person to do this job. He seems just to be walking through it.The Eighties were the time of the movies that celebrated youth and its many voices, ranging from S.E. Hinton and \'Ferris Bueller\'s Day Off\' to the dark Alpha Girl portraiture of \'Heathers,\' and John Hughes\' classics. This lacks their warmth and bite.But I still like Cera, and as has been said by a preview audience member, ""His fans will be in heaven"" with this.', '\'Youth in Revolt\' adapts the first three volumes of C.D. Payne\'s six-book series about Nick Twist, a smart and, in his own opinion anyway, more-than-usually horny 14-year-old in Oakland (""a large, torpid city across from San Frandisco"") who reports in daily journal form on a series of adventures encountered on the way to losing his virginity, despite the obstacles set up by his irresponsible divorced parents. Ironically, though pointed at today\'s young teens, \'Revolt\'s\' R rating excludes them -- though the books are far more sexually explicit. Whether somehow this will become a cult movie via Netflix is hard to say. It\'s pretty faithful to the books, leaving out lots, but adding or changing little. Unfortunately Arteta\'s flat direction, and focus on the action aspects -- an accident, a fire, a botched fake suicide, invasion of the girls\' dorm of a French-language prep school in Santa Cruz -- excises much of the self-satisfied wit of the books and Nick\'s one flourish, his intellectual and literary showing off. The film necessarily loses the flavor of a day-to-day-journal, though most of the characters tend to talk in the same ornate, overly-polite style as Nick\'s entries.C.D. Payne is no Salinger. His books serve as page-turners for young readers, but they\'re nothing special. There\'s a curious sense of being out of time. Is this the Nineties, when the books were begun?-- or the youth of Payne himself, who was born in 1949? Nick\'s girlfriend Sheeni (Portia Doubleday)\'s fascination with Belmondo, chanteur Serge Gainsbourg, and the existentialists, -- and the general innocence of the behavior -- would suggest earlier days, but in the movie, people have cell phones, and a prevalance of \'shrooms and blunts makes this post-Breathless (francophile Sheeni\'s favorite movie). The main point was to keep the incidents coming, and Payne went on with ""The Further Journals"" and finally the adventures of Twist\'s younger brother.Young Canadian actor Michael Cera, the star of Miguel Arteta\'s adaptation of this movie, who\'s now twenty-one, was already a TV veteran before he was ten. Though he appeared in many episodes of the cable series ""Arrested Development,"" and in retrospect we realize he played the young Chuck Barris in George Clooney\'s droll ramble \'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,\' he reached a kind of nerdy, adorable mega-stardom only a couple years ago with two big hits, \'Juno\' and \'Superbad,\' followed by the equally charming if less seen \'Nick and Nora\'s Infinite Playlist.\'What has Mike done with his stardom? Well, he played opposite Jack Black in Harold Ramis\' slapstick (and generally panned) prehistoric comedy \'Year One\' and co-starred with his now ex-girlfriend Charlene Yi in the poorly received \'Paper Heart.\'Cera has good timing and is adept at delivering lines, which makes him well suited for comedy.

Just because, not everyone in society has done \'shrooms so they probably wouldn\'t be able to relate to anything the characters go through when they take them. And while the movie portrays Michael Cera\'s character\'s experience as light-hearted and whimsical, shroom experiences, at least speaking for myself, are far from being light-hearted and whimsical. They\'re heavy drugs as far as I\'m concerned and the film almost makes you think otherwise and I might come off as preachy when I say this but it\'s highly irresponsible to portray taking mushrooms as such, given the influence that movies can have on young people who unfortunately may become super curious of taking them if they haven\'t already done so.

This black comedy has plenty of laughs amid a wacky, absurdist atmosphere.Nick Twisp. Great name for a fictional character; terrible name for a real person, I would think. Nick is into Frank Sinatra, his computer, and classic prose; he lives with his trailer-trash mom (Jean Smart) and her ne\'er-do-well current boyfriend (played with laid-back zeal by Zach Galifianakis). Nick is as stammery as any other Michael Cera character, and his approach to the fairer sex is, unsurprisingly, ineffective.Things look up when he meets neighbor Sheeni Saunders (Portia Doubleday, who is both enigmatic and ebullient as Sheeni), who\'s gorgeous and fun to be with. It\'s not long before Nick decides Sheeni\'s the one for him. But it\'s quickly revealed that Sheeni already has a boyfriend, a real manly man named Trent. How can anyone played by Michael Cera compete with a guy named Trent? Easy – by inventing an alter ego that gives voice to his rampaging id, a rogueish cad named Francois (because Sheeni loves French things). Francois allows Nick to do and say things that he\'d never otherwise say.And that\'s when things really take off. The pleasure of this movie is twofold. First, Cera\'s delivery and the script by Gustin Nash go together like Forrest Gump and Jenny. The jokes are often laugh-out-loud quality, and it\'s at least partly due to Cera\'s sometimes-mumbled, frightened-rabbit replies. His funny lines are played straight, and somehow it works. Second, the absurd escalating situations in which Nick finds himself – as a result of his own actions, it should be noted – are funny the same way Mr. Creosote\'s predicament was funny in Monty Python\'s The Meaning of Life. The stuff Nick does at the behest of Francois to win Sheemi\'s heart are hilarious yet unlikely – and yet they ring true nonetheless.It also helps that Cera is supported by some damn funny actors: Galifianakis is a hoot in a somewhat dark role; Steve Buscemi plays Nick\'s dad with vulgar intensity (as if he were a domesticated version of Mr. Pink); Justin Long, of all people, is Sheeni\'s stoner older brother; M. Emmett Walsh (who\'s perhaps a tad too old to be the father of a teen) is Sheeni\'s dad; Mary Kay Place is the mom; Smart as Nick\'s mom; and Adhir Kalyan as a fellow student who helps Nick in his quest for Sheeni. Oh, and Fred Willard as a neighbor who likes to save illegal immigrants from the INS.I know the word ""quirky"" is overused for oddball comedies today, particularly those starring Michael Cera (who, if he plays another Nick, may as well dot his face with bloodied pieces of tissue paper), but this one outquirks most of them. Even with all the madness zooming around this film, at the heart of things is the love between a girl and a boy and the lengths either will go to protect that bond.

Francois allows Nick to do and say things that he\'d never otherwise say.And that\'s when things really take off. The pleasure of this movie is twofold. First, Cera\'s delivery and the script by Gustin Nash go together like Forrest Gump and Jenny. The jokes are often laugh-out-loud quality, and it\'s at least partly due to Cera\'s sometimes-mumbled, frightened-rabbit replies. His funny lines are played straight, and somehow it works. Second, the absurd escalating situations in which Nick finds himself – as a result of his own actions, it should be noted – are funny the same way Mr. Creosote\'s predicament was funny in Monty Python\'s The Meaning of Life. The stuff Nick does at the behest of Francois to win Sheemi\'s heart are hilarious yet unlikely – and yet they ring true nonetheless.It also helps that Cera is supported by some damn funny actors: Galifianakis is a hoot in a somewhat dark role; Steve Buscemi plays Nick\'s dad with vulgar intensity (as if he were a domesticated version of Mr. Pink); Justin Long, of all people, is Sheeni\'s stoner older brother; M. Emmett Walsh (who\'s perhaps a tad too old to be the father of a teen) is Sheeni\'s dad; Mary Kay Place is the mom; Smart as Nick\'s mom; and Adhir Kalyan as a fellow student who helps Nick in his quest for Sheeni. Oh, and Fred Willard as a neighbor who likes to save illegal immigrants from the INS.I know the word ""quirky"" is overused for oddball comedies today, particularly those starring Michael Cera (who, if he plays another Nick, may as well dot his face with bloodied pieces of tissue paper), but this one outquirks most of them. Even with all the madness zooming around this film, at the heart of things is the love between a girl and a boy and the lengths either will go to protect that bond. This movie should appeal to those who like offbeat romances.', '""Youth in Revolt"" is original. It\'s not quite like any ""teen movie"" I\'ve ever seen. Just as its source material offered a fresh twist to the dork-meets-girl scenario in ink, the film offers the twist on screen.""Youth in Revolt"" centers on unconventional teenage rebels; these aren\'t the hoodlums you\'d expect to see smoking pot on street corners. In fact, these characters are essentially adults trapped in awkward teenage frames. They have sophisticated tastes and profound desires, but they also carry themselves clumsily and desperately try to shed their virginity. This mature immaturity makes both Nick (Cera) and Sheeni (Doubleday), along with a number of minor characters they meet throughout the film, compelling and unique human beings.As Nick Twisp, Michael Cera carries the film. His awkwardly clever narration provides for fairly consistent laughter, and his quest for Sheeni\'s heart puts him through a dramatic ringer. As good as Cera is as lovable loser Nick, nothing can prepare the audience for his work as Twisp\'s alter-ego: Francois Dillinger. Dillinger is the anti-Nick, which also makes him the anti-Michael Cera, but Cera pulls off his boldness and iron will hilariously. Cera\'s dual performance keeps the film fresh when it begins to get a little dull.As Sheeni, the primary love interest, Portia Doubleday concocts an unconventional leading lady. She seems to embody every characteristic of the female teenager at the same time, and it\'s not hard to see why Nick would idolize her.The film focuses on Cera and Doubleday for the most part, and their relationship is strange, and therefore refreshing. Clichés are avoided, unexpected roadblocks pop up, and teenage love rears its ugly, fascinating face. The romance seems real, as well as funny.When \'Youth in Revolt"" turns its focus away from the youths, it\'s hit-or-miss. Jean Smart is fine as Cera\'s aloof mother, but the character itself is one-dimensional and strangely conventional for such a nonconformist movie. Steve Buscemi is fine as the father, but he\'s not given much to do. The standouts among the supporting players include Fred Willard as an immigrant-phile, Justin Long as Sheeni\'s stoner brother, Mary Kay Place as Sheeni\'s Bible-wielding mother, and the two unknowns who portray Nick\'s friends, Lefty and BJ.Aside from a couple of intentionally quirky animated sequences and one or two clichéd stock characters, ""Youth in Revolt"" plays by its own rules, and it wins marvelously.', '""Youth in Revolt"" is original.

Payne\'s cult-favourite novel of the same name. Trying and failing to win the attention of the sexually sophisticated Sheeni Saunders (Portia Doubleday), Nick is visited by the realization that he needs to create an alter-ego, an edgy bad-boy named Francois Dillinger. Francois has blue eyes and a moustache, he smokes, he trashes Nick\'s record collection and coaches him through a spree of arson, property destruction and sexual triumph.The film, like Payne\'s book, is slightly\x85 off, in a very good way, three quarters heart-warming, smart character study and one quarter aggressive comic nihilism. There\'s an edge here, a very very pleasant one. It\'s left-field humour and frankness about boners makes the film feels like the work of people who are interested in the film as a funny film rather than as a vehicle. It\'s old-fashioned, a little punk, a little tiny bit jagged and very funny. The cast is outstanding, including performances by Jean Smart, Fred Willard, Ray Liotta, Steve Buscemi, Zach Galifianakis and newcomer Adhir Kalyan as Nick\'s partner-in-crime, Vijay. Arteta has filled the film, whose script is dense and literary, with more than enough visual humour and style to keep the film from getting too bogged down in its own witty verbosity.Arteta (who rose to deserved indie prominence with the excellent Star Maps and Chuck & Buck) has found in Cera a really rare comic actor at a really rare moment; a genuine talent on the verge of deserved super-stardom. Cera absolutely mastered (at 15 or 16 seemingly) the smart-funny anxious and awkward comedy of sweaty palms and gawkish, aware nerd-hood, starring as cousin-loving Michael in ""Arrested Development"" and Evan in his breakout hit Superbad. He\'s doing similar things in the very funny Youth in Revolt but what matters, what\'s exciting, is that Cera seems willing to modulate his image (an image that\'s worth literally millions of dollars) by taking roles in films like Arteta\'s not-exactly-totally-run-of-the-mill teen sex flick and this past summer\'s very neat, very brave Paper Heart. His role in Youth in Revolt belies both a self-awareness and a willingness to take risks, to poke and twist his safe ""Paulie from Juno"" image. Which is why he\'s still funny, despite the occasional disaster (Year One, Nick and Norah\'s Infinite Playlist). It\'s suggestive of longevity and legitimate wit, and as somebody who wholeheartedly loves funny people in funny films, it\'s exciting. My score: 8/10', 'Youth in Revolt stars Michael Cera as Nick Twisp, the nebbish-gone-wild hero of Miguel Arteta\'s adaptation of C.D. Payne\'s cult-favourite novel of the same name.

And yes, I was ecstatic when Michael Cera became a breakout star from the show after his awkward/naive George Michael role. Unfortunately, this had started to wear thin after he more-or-less reprised this role over and over again, with varying degrees of success. So along comes Youth in Revolt, which on the outset looks like Michael Cera playing George Michael again. Lo and behold, not only is Youth in Revolt hilarious, its also by far Cera\'s most diverse role yet.Youth in Revolt is about Nick Twisp. His mother has a boorish boyfriend Jerry whom Nick hates, and his father chases bimbos despite his lack of a job. When Jerry is on the run from some Russian sailors, the family goes up to a trailer park to lay low, where Nick meets Sheeni Saunders, who may well be the entire alternative/hipster scene wrapped up. She likes old music, French cinema and strange robot poetry. Eventually, the two start making out and such, but just as love blossoms, its back home for Nick.Of course, Nick won\'t let his ""true love"" get away that easy, and hatches a diabolical scheme to be back with her. To do so, he needs to break his nice-guy frame, doing so by inventing the mental persona Francois Dillinger. Francois is easily the best part of the film, also played by Cera but manifesting himself physically with Nick. Its some kind of Fight Club-ish thing going on, but the way its presented definitely feels fresh.This extra character is what puts Cera over the top. While Nick may be his standard character for the most part, Francois is a side of Cera not seen yet, very confident and moreover badass. Although part of me doubts Cera was able to grow that moustache himself. The Francois scenes are definitely the best of the film, and worth the price of admission alone.What would a comedy like this be without wacky supporting characters? This is where the movie is more hit-and-miss. Portia Doubleday is very serviceable as the idol of Nick\'s affection, and any guy who says he didn\'t majorly crush on a girl like that is clearly lying. Sure, her character is perhaps written as slightly to hipster to appease the fanbase, but the relation is by all means believable.Jean Smart stands out among the supporters as Nick\'s unsympathetic mother, as does Fred Willard as a very sympathetic teacher. Steve Buscemi and Zach Galifinakis get unfortunately little to do as Nick\'s father and his mother\'s boyfriend respectively. Ray Liotta is excellently used as an antagonistic cop. However, Justin Long comes across perhaps just a little too creepy as Sheeni\'s stoner brother, and her sweater-wearing boyfriend is simply far too much of a douche to be anything but a cliché.But whats important is that the movie is outright hilarious. Sure, there\'s better coming-of-age stories out there, but this one takes the cake in terms of simply making me laugh.

It's not much of an ending because in this movie nothing gets started to begin with.This movie is an endless drag, little goes on, little is said. Near the end I had enough and started fast-forwarding. No, this movie isn't even about relationships, as the characters have little to say to each other, avoid the important topics and barely speak. It's certainly not a sci-fi post apocalyptic movie either, after all, somehow where she lives there is no radiation, so she can live like a normal farmer would. This movie is about nothing at all.Is it based on a Christian book? That would perhaps explain the enthusiastic reviews. The new guy utters some meaningful lines about religion but there's very little religious here, nothing that would warrant a 10 rating. Performances are standard, nothing to go crazy about, it's not like the roles are very demanding. I haven't read the book and even if the book is great, the movie is just lousy.The only thing this pointless movie has going for it is the lovely Margot as a brunette playing the role of a sweet, innocent, religious country girl. It's a pleasure to see her.Unfortunately we don't learn here what the budget for the movie was. It couldn't have been a whole lot. But the end credits show that they got a lot of incentives from a lot of places they didn't even film in. These state bureaucrats may want to be more careful how they distribute tax-payer money."", ""At some point and time during this 1 and a half hour long snooze fest, it just randomly ends. <--That's it, for real, it just stops, no answers, no nothing. Watch QVC for an hour or so instead of this, at least you'll get some closure when the item changes and you know how many they sold. In fact I made this acct, and my very first review just to let everyone else know how bad this movie is. The character development is open ended, as we never get to know any of them. Without this attachment it's very hard to feel anything or become emotionally involved in the film.

At the beginning I was hooked because I was curious what will those characters do alone and what will happen at the end. Although it was common topic (some kind of apocalypse) I was still curious. Characters looked good and were played by the great actors. But after some time I was really bored. Nothing happened. And then I thought it will be interesting after the 3rd character comes so I waited. But no. After he came, nothing changed. It was still boring. There were no action whatsoever. It wasn't even relationship between characters. Nothing. At the end I was really disappointed. Do not watch this movie unless you like to waster your time.

I wanted to like the characters but I never really felt like I \'knew\' them. When the movie ended without any real answers.....ugh! The credits rolled and I couldn\'t believe that was it!

Maybe God... or your father... put this here for us. So we can... we can start again. Maybe that\'s why we\'re here... Just to start again.""The future prospects of our beloved world looks rather bleak, judging by the post-apocalyptic films of recent years. The endless series of disaster scenarios doesn\'t bode well. ""The Maze Runner"", ""Divergent,"" ""Mad Max,"" ""Oblivion,"" ""The Hunger Games"", ""Snowpiercer"", ""Automata"", ""How I live now"", ""World War Z"", ""The Well"" ... they all show a society that recovers on the ruins of a previous calamity. Similarly, ""Z for Zachariah"". You won\'t get a real explanation about the incident that led to a general extermination of our society. Reference is made to radioactivity and emerging nausea caused by polluted water. From this you can deduce that there might have been a nuclear war or accident in the past. But otherwise it is pure guesswork.It all started in an interesting way. A sober story with a sole survivor in a fertile valley (a ""Garden of Eden"" as it were), that was spared from the global holocaust one way or another. But this soberness gradually morphed into dullness. The emphasis gradually shifted from the apocalypse that took place in the world, to the complex, apocalyptic emotional world of a few surviving individuals. A love triangle is formed with reconstruction, religion, racial discrimination and jealousy as central themes. The fact that in all probability the world population was wiped out by a disaster, is relegated to the background and is only mentioned briefly afterwards as if it\'s irrelevant. What remains is an ordinary but complicated love story.I came across the following perspicacious summary : ""Z for Zachariah is a sex movie with a science-fiction coating and barely any sex."". It can easily be added to the list where films such as ""The Boy"" and ""Manglehorn"" appear in. Painfully slow films. What remains are the acting performances. An advantage (and maybe disadvantage at the same time) are the number of main characters. It\'s limited to three. Margot Robbie as the devout, farmer\'s daughter Ann Burden, who can drive a tractor to work the land without any problem but on the other hand feels rather inconvenient when it comes to intimate relations with someone of the male gender. Margot Robbie is a ravishing appearance as seen in ""Focus"", ""Suite française"", ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and ""About time"". Despite her fairly pathetic and bigoted look in this film, her natural beauty is still striking. She\'s joined by Chiwetel ""12 Years a Slave"" Ejiofor as the scientist John Loomis who is being rescued from a certain death by Ann after taking a refreshing bath in a toxic pond. The group is completed with Chris Pine as the not so bad-looking miner Caleb. He thwarts John\'s plans to re-populate the planet thoroughly.This film is based on the novella by Robert C. O\'Brien from 1974. I myself haven\'t read it and allegedly the film isn\'t really consistent with the book. For example, there would be no question of a third person. Knowing this, I think I\'ll let this book pass me, for even three people can\'t ensure that there\'s an intriguing, fascinating story. Let alone two. ""Z for Zachariah"" is a science fiction without much fiction, an erotically charged tale without eroticism and a pseudo-emotional story. Despite the nuclear disaster, the chemistry between the characters was hard to find.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT', 'Z for Zachariah is the least conventional end-of-the-world film I\'ve ever seen, and for the most part, I cannot figure out what to make of it. For the entire first half, it can\'t really figure out what it wants to do. There\'s no real story as Anne (Robbie) and John (Ejiofor), two separate survivors of a nuclear holocaust, meet and Anne nurses John back to health. Until Ejiofor is back on his feet, the film is relatively aimless as the director cuts between various shots of the valley and Robbie completing various chores. Even in the wider scheme of things, not much happens here - the film\'s plot is not much beyond building a water wheel while the characters interact around it.As they talk, we gather how much they are worlds apart - John is an older, black man of science who relishes in typical vices and Anne is a young, pure, white Christian girl whose never touched drink and likely never looked at a man. John wants Anne, but is conscious of their differences, so when the script sweeps them together, John gently pushes back and says that they can take their time. After all, there\'s no competition.But then there is. The mysterious and exceedingly polite Caleb appears in the valley out of nowhere, and he\'s everything John is not - he\'s a young white Christian boy who couldn\'t be more Anne\'s type if he tried. Here is where the film gets gripping. Director Craig Zerbel builds tension with a beautiful score, but this film is completely about the acting. Robbie dials back her supermodel good looks as best she can to play a plain-spoken country girl whose naivety is central to these two older men. Pine is unreadable and somewhat alluring, and his chemistry with Robbie is so off the charts that in one particular scene, I expected them to just start making out - despite John\'s presence in their midst.Ejiofor is the only reason I watched this movie, and he\'s the best part. This doesn\'t scratch his performance in 12 Years A Slave, but he had me sold from his first screams of joy. His delirium and drunkeness are incredibly believable. He can convey so much emotion without even trying - jealousy as Anne and Caleb share smouldering glances, embaressment as his jokes of repopulation go over the naive Anne\'s head, rage and hurt as he gives a half-hearted blessing to what he feels is inevitable, and naked honesty as he speaks about an earth- shattering revelation. Tiny mannerisms in his performance make his third wheel status not only believable but completely uncomfortable, and as a result, makes John the most empathetic character. The script is nothing special, but there is one reveal from John to Anne that actually made me drop what I was holding. Kudos all around. There\'s some beautiful mindgames between John and Caleb, with Caleb clearly outpacing John, who is clearly unaware of how to play this game. You just know that Caleb was wooing the local girls at school while John was in the library studying. When Caleb notes that something isn\'t in John\'s character, I completely agreed - because the characters created are so deep that I understood them intimately. However, that goodwill cannot erase the aimlessness that permeates the first half of the film, and what did exist was lost to me when the film ends. The final ten minutes were completely out of context and gave almost no closure on any issue. The rivalry between John and Caleb is left hanging, with one outcome implied but then the opposite suggested as the truth. It felt like the screenwriter was told ""pens down"" and then hastily crammed together a few words while the teachers were collecting the papers. Considering the direction Z for Zachariah was going, to end so badly was the final blow in a film that had far tested my patience already. 95 minutes? Doesn\'t feel like it.', '""Z For Zachariah"" (2015 release; 95 min.) brings the story of a couple of survivors of an unidentified contamination or radiation. As the movie opens, we see someone with a protective mask going through an empty town to pick up various things, including books from the library. When later the person takes off the mask, we see it is a young woman, named Ann. Ann and her dog live on their own, tending to the land and surviving as best they can. Then Ann runs into another survivor, a man named John. When John inadvertently takes a swim in a contaminated lake, he becomes very ill. Ann takes him home and nurtures him back to health. At this point we are 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you much more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you\'ll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, the movie\'s end titles say that the is ""Based on the book by Robert O\'Brien"", but it would have been better to have said ""very loosely based on/inspired by Robert O\'Brian\'s book"", as the plot for this film version differs dramatically and almost unrecognizably from the 1974 book. Since it is featured openly in the movie\'s trailer, besides Ann and John (the two characters in the book), the movie introduces a third character, Caleb. Second, while the setting of the movie is post-apocalyptic, the movie really doesn\'t feel all that much sci-fi. It\'s just three characters playing out their lives in an unspecified location somewhere in the US. In fact, the movie feels just as much being a Nicolas Sparks-like romantic drama than it is a sci-fi movie. Other elements featured in the movie include religion, and race. Third, the acting performances are strong. Up-and-coming Aussie actress Margo Robbie (also in The Wolf of Wall Street) does great work. She is definitely going places, that much is clear. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Chris Pine play John and Caleb, respectively. Fourth, the movie was mostly shot on location in New Zealand, with some additional shooting in West Virginia. Gorgeous sceneries most of the time. Last but certainly not least, there is a very nice orchestral score, composed by Heather ""The Instruments"" McIntosh.I had been looking forward to seeing this movie, and it finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The matinée screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great. If you are in the mood for a romantic drama with a slight sci-fi twist, you\'ll definitely want to check this out. On the other hand, if you read and loved the book, you will absolutely want to avoid this.', ""Science fiction movies have always aroused interest of directors and screenwriters and whetted the imagination of people. Z for Zachariah, based on the homonymous book by Robert C. O'Brien and directed by Craig Zobel, is a typical post-apocalyptic movie (to quote a recent film in that style we have the great The Survivalist - 2015) which focuses on drama and interpersonal relationships. Ann Burden (Margot Robbie, known for The Wolf of Wall Street - 2013) is a young woman who survived a nuclear disaster, which devastated almost the entire planet, in one of the only places not affected by the radiation: her family's farm. She lived alone with her dog Faro until the appearance of the scientist John Loomis (Chiwetel Ejiofor, known for 12 Years a Slave - 2013), which had managed to resist the tragedy thanks to its special costume. An affinity and a bond are established between them, but the arrival of another survivor, the mysterious Caleb (Chris Pine, known for the films Star Trek - 2009 and Star Trek Into Darkness - 2013), threatens the relationship between John and Ann and shatters the harmony of the place.The pace of the film is slow, focused on drama and the internal conflicts of the three characters. Instead of external threats and great action scenes or destruction, the plot deals with the complexities of the human mind, such as game of interests, distrust, fear of being alone and people's different reactions when subjected to extreme situations. Thus, the success of this type of narrative depends on tension and suspense created by the script coupled to casting and director's skills.The performances, by the way, left absolutely nothing to be desired. Chiwetel Ejiofor hands on all duality of his character, John, which is intelligent and skeptical, but at the same time, possessive and keeps some secrets. Margot Robbie embodies the role of Ann, a humble girl, religious, sweet and naive, which is vulnerable by the inexperience of life and the fear of loneliness. Chris Pine completes the cast of confused personalities with the mysterious and manipulative Caleb, who brings with him a dark past.The photograph, taken with long shots to explore the beautiful nature of the region, and the good soundtrack are positive features in the movie. But small failures in script and direction eventually delivered a smaller film than it could be. The dialogues and the atmosphere of tension and conflict between the characters should be better developed, especially in the third act. There is a visible continuity error in the movie: Ann's dog simply vanish after Caleb's arrival, with no explanation at all. The end, built ambitiously to enable viewer's reflection and imagination, leave some loose ends which causes the feeling that a few scenes lacked depth. After all, Z for Zachariah creates tension and drama in some moments, besides having great performances.Originally posted in: https://vikingbyheart.blogspot.com.br"", ""New Zealand must be a beautiful country. I've never seen a movie filmed there that was not.It's a not so ironic setting for a movie about the end of the world, as the film focuses on the emotions of three survivors of the apocalypse instead of the apocalypse itself. A good Christian woman left behind by her family who went to help others. A man of science looking to move forward and rebuilt, and the all-American heart throb who rains on the parade.Chiwetel Ejiofor gave a compelling performance. it was so real, I think the majority of us would understand what he's going through. I was shocked by how outstanding Chris Pine was in this movie, just perfect. Margot Robbie was amazing as well, just a solid piece of acting by all.It made for the perfect emotional love triangle. Even though only three people appear in this movie, it said so much about us as a society. I love sci-fi and I want to count this as one of the great Sci-fi stories ever told from beginning to end, and the outcome leads an interesting taste in my mouth.It was a fantastic 97mins at the movies."", ""This is probably the quietest and most understated post-apocalyptic movies you'll ever see, but deep down, it is truly fascinating. With great performances, impressive directing and an intriguing plot, this film is massively engrossing and surprisingly simple to understand from start to finish.First things first, however, this isn't a sci-fi in any way. The setting is in the post-apocalypse world, however that bears pretty much no relevance to the development of the plot as a whole, it's just a background to put these three characters together in a more desperate and dramatic situation.Instead, this is more of an indie romantic drama, so be warned, sci- fi fans, there's nothing here for you if you're just looking for something exciting and action-packed.What this actually is is a fascinating study of humans in their most basic state: survival and animalistic desires, relating itself almost to Adam and Eve and biblical theory.Therefore, the most captivating part of this film is the relationships that develop between the three main characters, as each of the men gets closer to Margot Robbie's character, tensions begin to rise and a clash becomes inevitable, however watching these people act in such a basic way, driven by their pure desire for procreation, is hugely fascinating throughout, and at times even thrilling.What really helps that to be so is the performances. Margot Robbie, in the female lead, is okay. It's not a stunning performance in any way, but her character isn't really the most interesting, as apart from her devout Christianity, she's only really there to set the spark off between the two men.As a result, it's Chiwetel Ejiofor and Chris Pine that are most impressive. Pine plays a slightly smaller role, but successfully asserts his position within the trio and causes huge complications that turn Chiwetel Ejiofor's character into the most interesting. Ejiofor's performance perfectly conveys his character's natural frustration and desperation in this situation, and that makes him absolutely brilliant to watch.Finally, something's got to be said about the directing here. Instead of fitting in in a long line of post-apocalyptic movies, this film, thanks to director Craig Zobel, doesn't feel cold and as if there is some intense impending danger, but the lush nature of the landscape that the film is shot against and the clear serenity of the environment makes this a much warmer and calmer film that makes it all the more pleasant and engaging to watch."", ""I'm always a little shocked after watching the movie, reviewing the DVD cover art. I'm reminded of the 'Wild Things' the Pseudo-sexual melodrama type flick.This is not that. Its a very watchable simple and interesting take on relationships among 3 people after an apocalyptic event.Margo Robbie is as always stunning, and I don't mean her looks. It's so easy to categorize her as another Hollywood starlet because of her looks. The truth is - took me most of the movie to recognize her. She is a consistent standout performer in what she does. Chiwetel Ejiofor, easy to recognize - because of another flawless performance, he always manages to understate the situation leaving the audience that little bit of self understanding to make up the rest.The other guy was good too. Chris Pine probably the most bankable asset on the movie, actually stood his ground and was a balanced foil, to manage the drama. Forgive my chagrin, I am still smarting over the Cinderella movie.Simple script, simple story well told. Thank god it was totally free of the god awful melodrama the artwork suggests. But it drags you in, thanks to excellent character development.Good work all round, total package nice movie. No worries."", ""Just saw this movie at Sundance and thoroughly enjoyed it. While certainly not perfect, the film was beautifully shot, scored, and directed. As a post-apocalyptic film, it took a unique take on what was essentially a small group of survivors after nuclear fallout. However, instead of focusing on the apocalyptic elements themselves, it focused on the human drama that resulted and the emotional responses to this extreme sort of isolation.I had essentially no expectations coming into the film and found myself completely invested in the storyline, which develops methodically but beautifully. The writing hits all the turning points within each character's development at just the right time, with just enough delicacy. In turn, the actors all delivered superb performances.I had only seen Margot Robbie in The Wolf of Wall Street previously, and I was highly impressed by her perhaps more subtle turn here. I thought she did a wonderful job of portraying a woman trying to preserve her faith and even innocence in trying circumstances. Likewise, Chiwetel Ejiofor portrayed his character's shortcomings in an extremely relatable, human way.Chris Pine's introduction into the film basically becomes the linchpin for the majority of the rest of the movie's tension, and Pine's typical suave-ness does not disappoint. Ultimately, a story of jealousy, desire, and necessity emerges, with the sense of isolation and loneliness prevailing, with an ending that leaves you thinking afterwards. 8/10."", 'A movie about three survivors that avoided radiation from an unknown event that keeps you thinking the whole time.This movie was really interesting. With only the 3 characters the movie did not struggle to give each character a personality, and not feel out of place. Craig Zobel seems to know how to make you uneasy. The whole movie I felt uneasy at what was going on and was never really sure what was going to happen. While Compliance was a whole different level of uncomfortable, this movie actually had me cringing in anticipation quite a few times.Margot Robbie - Nailed her character. I felt like she really pulled it off.Chris Pine - Also did well, there were a few scenes that I thought he felt out of character but all in all really well done.Chiwetel Ejiofor - I think he also nailed his character. I could see an argument against him for a lack of emotion in some scenes but I felt like it was intentional and that he pulled it off really well.All in all I would definitely recommend it.', 'Some films make you cry, some films make you laugh and some films just  amaze you. Well, this one will make you think and digest information  that you will see. Z for Zachariah may not be the most romantic film  nor may it be an adventure, but hours after watching it, I was still  thinking about what this film represents  The story is set in a Valley. However, it is a post-apocalyptic time.  The area outside of the Valley is completely covered in radiation, but  somehow the valley is clean. At the moment, only one girl lives there.  However, two more men join her at her farm, and soon friendship takes  an unexpected turn. If you would like to find out what happens, you  have to see the film.  I honestly think the film is good, but the real impact starts after it  ends. Let me explain. The film\'s story makes it feel like it is  building up to something big. But the actual ""boom"" comes to you after  the film as you start to think a lot about the story and the  characters, which is very unique and I think, genius. The acting and  directing is interesting. It feels like the actors truly live through  their characters. However I think the ending is a bit abrupt. If there  was an epilogue or something like that, it would have felt more  complete \x96 even if it was only symbolic.  My favorite scene is when one of the men arrives and he already is  rather friendly with the main female character. They just accomplished  something big and they decide to have a bit of fun. The girl dresses up  the dog and it is one of the few funny scenes. I like how it shows  people that even after the worst possible things, we can still have fun  and laugh.  Honestly this film is rather mature and it\'s a drama. So, I recommend  it for ages 12 to18. Kids this age could appreciate the story and the  concept of this thought-provoking film better than younger ages. I give  this film four out of five stars because, although the film has  wonderful acting and directing, I think the story was a bit incomplete  and some scenes were stretched out which made it a bit boring. Reviewed  by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.', ""Following a disastrous event which wipes out most of human civilization, a scientist named John Loomis (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and a mysterious minor named Caleb (Chris Pine) are competing for the affection of a woman named Ann Burden (Margo Robbie) who may be the last woman on earth on a farm somewhere within the southern United States that is seemingly unaffected by the whole crisis. Now they must face the challenge of rebuilding society with the hopes that there could still be more survivors out there.I will start off by saying that you have to be patient while watching this. Sure it takes a little while before things start to happen but it fits within the film's story. There are few people left on the planet which does make the excitement level low. I didn't mind this because I thought the acting all around was very good with Robbie shining as a woman trying to maintain her faith despite the crisis around her. I was surprised by how good her southern accent was considering she is Australian. Ejiofor and Pine were great as Ejiofor's Loomis came off as real and relatable and Pine's Caleb creating tension within the relationship between Ann and John. The film is advertised as a sci- fi film but that begins and ends with the offscreen series of events which led to where the characters are at the beginning of the film. The film is more of a study of the human experience or what is like to feel alone and isolated from the world. The film does a great job at this by how beautifully it is shot. I know I've often spoken of this but this one does it better than most. Shot in both West Virginia and New Zealand, the film really captured the vastness of the film's desolate landscape. I felt that its vastness juxtaposed with the few people left really emphasized how alone and isolated they were from the rest of the world. As I mentioned before, not very much happens but what kept me engaged was that I didn't know how the story was going to go. The writing here was great because of the unpredictable story and the dialogue was also excellent. I thought the characters were real and genuine for the most part with a great degree with depth and the dialogue flowed naturally and seldom felt bad or cheesy. You don't know how the story is going to go because you are never completely sure of each of the character's true intentions since they never felt predictable. When it comes to the book (which I didn't know the film was based on until after I saw it), I cannot speak to how the film compares. That being said, I was not a fan of the end either. Overall, Z for Zachariah is great film that fans of sci-fi and romance will enjoy and it doesn't beat you over the head with either.Score: 8/10 keithlovesmovies.com"", 'Greetings from Lithuania.""Z for Zachariah"" (2015) is another movie in a crowded post- apocalypse genre. I called it a genre because there a lot of movies in recent years which take place in post-apocalypse earth. Although usually budgets of these movies aren\'t big, i liked these type of films. ""Z for Zachariah"" is a very good movie and entry to this so called genre. Most of humanity gone for very barely explained reasons, and we see only a bunch of survivors. I won\'t spoil anything, just going to say that script of this movie is good, while direction and cinematography are solid. The true star of this movie is Margot Robbie in my opinion, playing Ann. She steals every scene and is a true talent. Chiwetel Ejiofor is very solid and reliable as usual, but Chris Pine was miscast - he is a good actor in ""Star Treck"" movies and fine in action films, but as a dramatic actors he lacks the skill.Overall, ""Z for Zachariah"" is a slow burning, involving low key drama with some strong performances. The only downside is that it\'s not a very memorable movie - after some time you won\'t remember it much, but while it lasts, it\'s very pleasant to watch.', ""It must be stated that this movie's User Rating of 6.1 and Metascore of 68 do not do it any justice. As the rating are usually a pretty fair indicator of a movies quality, I went in expecting a decent movie but perhaps nothing exceptional. Now, after having watched it, I am happy to report that it far surpassed my initial expectations. First and foremost the acting in this movie is superb. Chiwetel Ejiofor, 12 Years a Slave, gives an absolutely spectacular performance (again). He is rapidly becoming one of my favorite actors to date. He has moments of beautiful reserve but you can always feel the fire brewing down inside. Awesome, just awesome stuff. Margot Robbie, The Wolf of Wallstreet, sheds the Brooklyn accent and personality and absolutely shines as the shy southern beauty in this film. She too is rapidly showing her wonderful acting chops and presenting herself as a force to be reckoned with. She makes a seamless transition from a supporting role in Wolf, to starring opposite Chiwetel here. The icing on the cake in this film is Chris Pine's performance. He shows that he is much more than a dreamy Captain Kirk in the Star Trek reboots. This is by far my favorite performance of his. It just feels human. kudos. The direction was beautiful. While this movie is technically considered Sci-Fi, Mr. Zobel does an outstanding job making this into a character study. He balances the actors performances beautifully and the film is a perfectly trimmed piece of lean meat. Not once does it drag or feel rushed. The characters and story develop organically and its a mesmerizing thing to follow. The cinematography by Tim Orr also needs mentioning. Orr captures some enchanting nature shots that really play nicely into the story. Beyond all the obvious technical triumphs of this film, I think that perhaps my favorite part may be the sheer depth of the story. I'll avoid specifics on the plot, as I don't want to risk throwing out any spoilers but its suffice to say that this certainly is not a run of the mill love story. There are a lot of religious elements, a lot of nature and mankind talking points, and philosophical debates that will leave you thinking long after the credits role. Overall, I was more than pleasantly surprised by this wonderful film. I would absolutely recommend it.""]",17,"['Drama', 'Science Fiction', 'Thriller']"

Well, maybe the raunchy part...The premise is this: Two down on their luck best friends (Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks) decide to make a porn film so they can pay the rent. They hold auditions for the rest of the cast (ugh... another audition of misfits scene) and then begin to film x rated versions of famous films.This first problem is that this premise has been done before and better in other films. The idea also seems dated. With porn so available via the internet these days, would anyone really care about a homemade porn film? Another problem is the casting of the very attractive Elizabeth Banks who is not believable as the misfit she is portraying. It is also unbelievable that her character would agree to do the porn film in the first place. It also bothered me how it was never really discussed how they planned to market the film to make their money back.The one part that did make me laugh was the high school reunion with a very funny appearance by Brandon Routh and Justin Long as gay lovers. Aside from that scene, the film was nothing more than gross out gags and cheap attempt at laughs at the expense of a decent believable story. I didn\'t buy the overly sentimental ending either.', ""Struggling roommates come up with an idea to make a quick buck in this lame comedy. The script is amateurish and humorless. What's more, there isn't a single two-dimensional character here. Everybody is a caricature and the relationship between Rogan and Banks is never believable. In fact, all the characters are so crude and rude that they don't resemble really people. The film is based on the sophomoric premise that the f-word is funny, and that cramming multiple f-words into every line will make the film hilarious. Not only does the comedy not work at all, but the later attempt to turn the film into a touching romance falls completely flat."", ""While a far better film than 2001's Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Zack and Miri Make a Porno is not nearly as good as 2006's Clerks II.Craig Robinson and Jeff Anderson gave outstanding performances, as did the always-good Justin Long. Jason Mewes was also particularly funny, and so was Katie Morgan, who I recognized from two films that I saw in college: Katie Morgan: A Pornstar Revealed and Women In Black II. The lead actors were funny too.However, even with these strong performances, the film is very predictable and rather boring. There are a few laugh-out-loud jokes, but the audience has to wait for quite a while in between these jokes.I'm glad I saw it, but I don't care if I ever see it again."", ""Although this movie had a nice start,with quite a few good jokes it failed to become much more than that.I was hoping to see something different,a breath of fresh air in the mass off generic,cheap teenage comedies.Unfortunately Zack and Miri are stuck somewhere in the middle of an sandwich and it's not pleasant at all.The first half of the movie I admire the most.This part is filled with something,not to say original but different,and actually has something fresh to bring to audience.Closer we are getting to ending movie starts dragging us in different direction,from unique and funny comedy towards cheap romantic flick filled with every possible cliché there is in a book.Actually it started becoming so bad it literally erased all enjoyable moments this movie did offer.Only thing that stopped me from turning it off was pure boredom.Disappointed,to say at least."", 'Just in time for Halloween, one of the original independent filmmakers, Kevin Smith, gives us something truly frightening \x85 Seth Rogen in a porno. No offense to Seth; I think he\'s cuddly and all but porn material, I think not. Or maybe I\'ve just been out of the straight porn- watching world for so long that this is what porn has come to. That said, I doubt I\'ll be making a trip to my local video shop later to catch up on everything I\'ve missed. What\'s that? I don\'t have to leave my home for this sort of fare anymore? It is all readily available online at the click of my mouse? And what? I\'m supposed to be talking about Smith\'s latest mild chuckle fest, ZACK AND MIRI MAKE A PORNO? I thought we were discussing film worth leaving the house for. ZACK AND MIRI is not that film. Maybe you could download it, I guess.Zack and Miri may be making a porno but it is Kevin Smith making another lazy film that we should be focusing on. See, Smith is hoping that his sensational premise is enough to get you laughing ecstatically. He is primarily hoping for this because this way he can pass off his tired characters and simple jokes as something brand new, something no one has ever tackled in film before. Actually, that is giving him too much credit. The truth of the matter is that Kevin Smith is one of the most overrated filmmakers making movies today. He\'d probably be the first to agree with me. This is because Smith doesn\'t really care about his work and you can feel it in every cliché his characters exist and every joke he sets up. How else can you explain married couple characters who yell at each other incessantly and complain even more so about how horrific and sexless marriage is? Or a party sequence where the camera doesn\'t move while we jump cut from one dancing fool to the next in full frame? And how can anyone these days justify using the word ""faggot"" as a meaningless insult, tossed around irresponsibly? Limited is the first word that comes to my mind.Getting back to Zack and Miri (Rogen and the luminous Elizabeth Banks), they are the most enjoyable and charismatic things about this film. Zack and Miri have been friends forever and never have they crossed that scary line and stepped into the realm of sex between friends. They live together, if you want to call their situation living. They\'re months behind on their rent; their electricity and water have been shut off; and neither one has a job that can actually get them out of this mess they\'ve found themselves in. Naturally, they turn to the world of pornography for salvation. After all, they just found out that they have access to hundreds of contacts on their high school alumni mailing list that will no doubt jump at the chance to see this infamously platonic twosome finally get it on. I don\'t know about you but if I was so down on my luck that I needed to make porn to bail myself, I\'m pretty positive that the high school acquaintances that teased and taunted me at my most fragile moments would not be the first people I would be peddling my wares to. In fact, they would be right up there with my mom. The irony of ZACK AND MIRI MAKE A PORNO is that Kevin Smith should feel right at home with the kinds of lower production values pornography calls for. In fact, I think I may have seen amateur porn that is subtler and more original than this film. It is not without its charm or its laughs but ZACK AND MIRI MAKE A PORNO is as forgettable as most of Smith\'s work and not nearly as intriguing as actual porn.', 'For those that don\'t already know, the second half to that ""Zack and Miri"" title is ""Make a Porno"", three little words that have caused a lot of fuss lately. In addition to being deliberately shortened on TV, Kevin Smith (Clerks, Chasing Amy) has had to fight for even the R-rating, a teaser trailer had to be removed from his website, the posters for the flick were so raunchy that the characters could only appear as stick figures(of which Seth Rogen is assuredly not), and already certain theaters have decided not to show it while openly showing Saw V and Max Payne without a moments hesitation. All this for one of the years nicest romantic comedies. ""Zack and Miri"" is vintage Kevin Smith, blending the cheerily offensive with heartfelt sentimentality, and while its nothing groundbreaking or even terribly gratuitous (sure there are some cock and ball, ass, and boob shots but what comedy doesn\'t have those now-adays), it\'s also one of Smith\'s most successful attempts with the formula.Seth Rogen plays Zack and Elizabeth Banks plays Miri, two best friends living in a crummy little apartment in Pittsburgh. The bills are stacking up , the heat and electricity have been turned off and they\'re about to be thrown out on their ass. What do two struggling thirty-somethings do? While crashing their High School reunion, they discover that the school\'s former Quarterback (Superman Return\'s Brandon Routh) is actually gay and the boyfriend of gay porn star Brandon (Justin Long). This gives Zack an idea and after ruminating over it for a night, he and Miri both decide that a cheap porno is the only way to solve their money woes. They enlist the help of Zack\'s coffee shop co-worker Delaney (Craig Robinson) to be producer and also bring on a rag tag team of actors (Jason Mewes, Jeff Anderson, Traci Lords, Katie Morgan, and Ricky Mabe), first to shoot the movie ""Star Whores"" with such characters as R2-Teabag, Hung Solo, and Darth Vibrator and then when that encounters a shooting problem, they decide to do a coffee shop porn called ""Swallow my Cock-Ucinno"".The problem Smith often encounters is that sometimes it feels like he\'s throwing F-words, vibrator, pussy, and jerk-off jokes at us a little too easily and it doesn\'t really jive well with the sweeter side that comes later. As an example, watch ""Jersey Girl."" Just here he has a good balance for the most part. It starts off a little shaky but settles in nicely with crude jokes that earn big laughs. A diarrhea gag is priceless, a character named Bubbles has a unique talent, and the names themselves are great fun, take the David Mamet inspired ""Glen and Garry Suck Ross\' Cock"" for example. It gets gooey but Smith keeps things down to Earth with an endearing love story about sex and the jealousy and uncomfortable and sensitive nature that surrounds it. It\'s nothing new. Everything mentioned has been explored to death on every network sitcom ever produced but it keeps its sweetness and that\'s really what counts here.Rogen is a big, doughy, lovable ball of enthusiasm and he\'s always fun to watch. And Banks is adorable, has good comedic chemistry with Rogen but most importantly both actors bring a gentle and heartwarming romance to the screen. The rest of the cast is a big help, starting with ""The Offices"" Craig Robinson, who nails every line the character has, whether it\'s defying what he believes to be racism, talking about his wife, or nervously auditioning porn stars, he\'s the funniest character in the movie hands down. A close second is Justin Long, hilariously flamboyant and filled with gay pride to the point of being applause-worthy, this character deserves his own movie. And Jason Mewes is at his crude best in every scene he\'s in. ""Zack and Miri"" gets very good performances from everybody and it manages to do what a lot of romantic comedies this year have not been able to do, which is earn the laughs and earn the love of it\'s two characters. It\'s funny, fun, and you don\'t even need a condom to enjoy it. Let\'s see ""Max Payne"" try to make a similar claim.', 'Roommates and longtime friends Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) meet a gay couple (Brandon Routh and Justin Long) at a high school reunion held on the eve of Thanksgiving. One of these guys (Routh) is so handsome and charming Miri crudely and of course futilely propositions him on the spot. Zack happens to talk to his lover (Long, hilariously deep-voiced and confident). It turns out the gay men produce and act in their own profitable line of gay porn films. They really are good-looking and have it together, and Zack and Miri, being so broke their electricity and water have been cut off, decide to make a porno of their own. The plot twist, obvious in conventional romantic comedy terms, is that the process of shooting a sex scene with them in it makes Zack and Miri, who, we don\'t know exactly why, have contented themselves with hasty, meaningless sex with others up to now, realize--after a slight delay--that they\'ve really loved each other along.Smith\'s use of Seth Rogen in a schlub-wins-pretty-girl comedy (there\'s no doubt that Elizabeth Banks is pretty) links him with Judd Apatow\'s productions, but let\'s hope he isn\'t swallowed up by the Apatow factory. Apatow can do anything, but in spite of the success of \'Knocked Up,\' \'Super Bad,\' \'Forgetting Sarah Marshall\' and \'Pineapple Express,\' I wish he\'d go back to producing really good failed TV series like \'Freaks and Geeks\' and \'Undeclared,\' where Seth got started and Judd gave birth to all the good comedy.Kevin Smith\'s continuing appeal is his own. It lies in his faithfulness to his New Jersey ""Askewniverse"" regional working-class outlook and in his ability to call a spade a spade, ""spade,"" in this case, being a string of four-letter words. He has never strayed far from his basic concerns even when more money came his way, as it did as soon as his under-$30,000 debut production \'Clerks\' was snapped up by Miramax and feted at Sundance and Cannes. Smith\'s movies are frank and contemporary, outrageous and funny. Above all they\'re sui generis, a quality achieved through adhering closely to favorite tropes and locales and a posse of pals.His dead-end mallrats entering their thirties without accomplishment or future speak truth, and the best things about his movies has always been the dialogue, which is spiky and arresting and nonstop and alive, even if he avoids polish so studiously that the lines aren\'t as memorable as they might be. Or is it just that I\'m too old to be fully tuned in to the language, even though I understand it? Relationships and situations get honest treatment, even though they\'re hardly explored in depth. He\'s also good at politics and religion, as in \'Dogma\', which took things a step beyond \'Clerks.\' Raised as an Irish Catholic, Smith delighted in insulting the Church, but the Catholic League didn\'t take his provocations lightly. Sometimes drawing on Ben Afleck and Matt Damon and other celebs, he\'s kept going back to the same crew of actor-friends and characters, including Jason Lee, Brian O\'Halloran, Mr. Affleck, Betty Aberlin, Jeff Anderson, Walter Flanagan, Ernest O\'Donnell, or course Kevin Smith himself (""Silent Bob""), and my own favorite and the most frequent of all, the provocative yet needy Jason Mewes. Smith\'s last movie was \'Clerks II,\' which much like Zack, highlighted a sexually outrageous act in a shoddy fast food joint. A good addition here is Zack\'s black cohort from his place of work, Delaney (Craig Robinson of the US TV ""The Office""), who has great timing and delivery, and becomes the porno\'s producer.In a way Zack even directly reenacts what Smith actually did when he shot \'Clerks\'--he made a movie at night in the New Jersey convenience store where he was then working in the daytime. The crew in Zack wind up making their porno at night in the non-Starbucks coffee shop called Bean-N-Gone where Zack and Delaney work. Predictably, a guy (Tyler Labine) comes in in the wee hours to buy a cup of coffee so he can drive home. He\'s so drunk he doesn\'t notice that one of the new porn recruits and Jason Mewes are having sex on a platform in front of the counter. This time, even though it\'s put off and partly an afterthought, the main characters not only find love but success in free enterprise--with their friends.Smith\'s dialogue never falters. But I confess to an increasing nostalgia for the purity and simplicity of the original Clerks. That had a promise, a sense of how ordinary guys could be witty and smart, a sense that though nothing was happening, something momentous still might. It hasn\'t. \'Zack and Miri\' doesn\'t take us any further than \'Clerks II\' did; I think \'Clerks II\' even had cleverer dialogue. This time down-and-dirty language is beginning to feel wearisome. It\'s beginning to feel forced. People don\'t talk that way all the time--at least women don\'t. But that doesn\'t mean Smith\'s fans are burned out. The Weinstein brothers have picked up this one, and nobody\'s going to lose any money. Last time I compared Kevin Smith to Eric Rohmer. That may seem far fetched at first, due to Rohmer\'s delicacy vs. Smith\'s gross-out factor. But both filmmakers are essentially perpetual adolescents who write good dialogue. Both of them go back to the same themes every time. Rohmer doesn\'t make a masterpiece every time and neither does Smith. But you keep coming back. I still like this vulgarian indie auteur.', ""First off, do not watch this with your parent, grandparents or in-laws. You can definitely feel that this is a Kevin Smith feel, and the fact that it has Jason Mewes in it could have been a strong hint also. Zack and Miri Make a Porno is a strange but enjoyable love story, cleverly written by Smith so that you do actually feel the romance behind the porn. No this movie isn't a major Hollywood blockbuster, and it is definitely not for everyone, if you're a prude give it a miss, but if light hearted and don't mind movies with the full range of body organs then I would recommend watching this!"", 'As Jackie Treehorn laments in The Big Lebowski, pornos these days lack plot, and production values, and feelings. Kevin Smith\'s ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" would make Jackie quite proud.The basic plot revolves around two friends, Zack and Miri. The two have a platonic relationship and live together. As they hit dire financial straits, Zack suggests they should make a porno and sell it to make money to pay rent, utilities, etc.I went into this film with some hesitation. I left quite impressed. Seth Rogen proves he can convey emotion and still be funny. Elizabeth Banks provides the perfect on-screen mate for Rogen. However, I feel, as did others who saw the preview, that Craig Robinson (Darrell from The Office) steals nearly every scene he is in.Zack and Miri heartily earns its R rating. It is easy to see how the MPAA nearly rated it NC-17. No matter the rating, I would whole-heartedly recommend this movie to anyone (with the exception of grandparents).', 'It is difficult to imagine a title that will more or less tell you almost everything major that happens in the movie you are about to see than Zack & Miri Make a Porno. The title pretty much sums up the whole film right there, in the broad strokes. But, as with most things, the meat is in the subtext. What the title doesn\'t tell you is that while making a porno, Zack & Miri, and their other accomplices, will make you laugh pretty hard. Zack & Miri Make a Porno may not be high art, but it is very funny movie, with a touch of heart to go along with it.Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) have been best friends for as long as they can remember. They live together, but in a completely platonic relationship, drive to work together and both attend their school reunion together. Things are a bit rough for them these days, though: their rather meager jobs are not bringing in enough money to keep the rent paid and all the utilities running. So, after running into an old classmate whose lover is the star of porno films in California, they hit upon a brilliant scheme to make some money: make a porno film.In short order, they raise some capital from a co-worker (Craig Robinson), recruit a stripper, Stacey (Katie Morgan), Lester (Jason Mewes),a man who isn\'t afraid to expose himself, a cameraman (Jeff Anderson) and Zack and Miri plan to round out the cast themselves. However, in the process of getting down to business, Zack and Miri are realizing that their long-standing friendship may actually be something more, and can they manage to watch each other get it on with someone else after discovering that they may only want to be with each other.One thing is certain: if you are not able to listen to frank jokes featuring almost every vulgar word in the English language, not to mention a fair dose of nudity and simulated sex, you should be looking elsewhere for an evening at the movies. Zack & Miri Make a Porno pulls few punches in these categories. If this is not an issue for you, then Zack & Miri will provide a plethora of laughs. As scripted by Kevin Smith, Zack & Miri is one hilarious joke after another, most of which comes from Smith\'s always impressive ability to weave some terrific conversations full of wit between his various characters. Zack & Miri Make a Porno, like all of Smith\'s best films, is all about the dialogue, and it works wonderfully, as always.Seth Rogan is proving to be an actor who manages to give a performance that seems so completely unforced and natural. Zack, like many of Rogan\'s other roles, is a slice of life guy, and Rogen manages to make it seem like you are just watching a friend that you filmed around the house with a video camera. Elizabeth Banks is equally good in the role of Miri, and the two characters have a nice, natural chemistry, that evokes it\'s power when the two film their first sex scene for the porno, which Smith stages tastefully and scores with a great, unreleased song by Live. You know you care about what happens to these characters once this scene hits.The supporting cast is strong, especially Robinson as Zack\'s co-worker who is principally interested in financing this film so he can see some women naked after being married for so long (A scene between his character and his wife late in the film is a riot) and Jason Mewes, no longer under the influence of drugs, proves that he will do almost anything in a film and gets plenty of laughs.Zack & Miri Make a Porno is Kevin Smith\'s second turn at a film outside of his ""View Askewniverse"" series of films that he kicked off with Clerks, and it shows that Smith has ability to produce a funny film without exclusively relying on his old standby characters. In the process of doing so, he has crafted something that, if you can handle the racy nature of the material, will leave you in stitches.', ""I saw this movie at the opening of Fantastic Fest in Austin, with Kevin Smith live. The whole theater was roaring with laughter for at least 3/4 of the movie. If you're a fan of his films, you won't be disappointed. If you're not, get the hell on board, cause this movie is hilarious. The movie has some of his most classic scenes by far, with some great performances and spectacular lines by Justin Long, Rogen, Mewes, and Craig Robinson who steals the show. I guarantee you won't leave the theater unsatisfied. It's like Clerks 2 had sex with Dogma, and left the horrendous emotional scenes at the door, and kept the bad ass dialogue thoroughly intact."", 'I love deceptive marketing campaigns. Usually, they make movies hit-or-misses financially, but deceptive marketing shows a lot of faith in a film, which is what every viewer should have in this one. Have faith in the fact that this film, despite being controversial and borderline wrong in some parts, is one of the funniest and sweetest romantic comedies of the decade. What happens when you mix Kevin Smith\'s witty and snappy dialog with the outrageous humor of a guy like Seth Rogen? Pure brilliance, that\'s what.Z&M is a movie of depth and emotion. Yes, I\'m talking about the movie with the extremely blunt title. What I like about both of our \'names\', Smith and Rogen, is that no matter how raunchy they get, no matter how much they cross the line, they have a habit of making their films have real heart. It\'s the same here, and it looks like everyone involved had fun making the film...in every sense of the word...What makes the movie work so well is the amazing platonic and romantic chemistry of the two leads, Rogen and Elizabeth Banks (who is quickly becoming one of my favorites). I can\'t think of two performers who have skyrocketed more in terms of fame over the last three years, and to see them together again after The 40 Year Old Virgin was a good treat. They work so well together that I found myself smiling at them in pretty much every scene they share (or, 80% of the movie), and it makes the experience so much better. They really make you feel comfortable and warm inside (I can hear the sex jokes coming already).It\'s not just our wonderful leads that make the movie great, it\'s performers like Jason Mewes (playing a variant of his usual \'Jay\' character), Jeff Anderson, and Craig Robinson that really help, because any scene without Banks & Rogen together has Robinson or Mewes, who form a type of foundation for the great performances of Banks & Rogen. Of course, the film features a few porn stars and a few cameos as well, the best coming from Justin Long and Brandon Routh. I was dying.Of course, not only do you get heart with Rogen and Smith, but you get surefire jaw dropping jokes that will make you say, ""did they really just do that?"". One of the jokes I\'m speaking of comes at Jeff Anderson\'s expense. The vulgarity of Rogen\'s comic style, mixed with Smith\'s wicked fast writing is the perfect compliment and a great recipe for laughter. Z&M certainly won\'t deliver as many laughs as films like Superbad or Knocked Up, but that\'s mostly because the film is more serious, desperate, and shorter (but of course, still very light hearted).I guess the only thing I didn\'t like was the lack of resolution with the subplot of the actual porno, but that\'s just wishful thinking, as the end is more than satisfying (as well as clever and hilarious). People are obviously going to be hesitant about seeing this movie because of the blunt title and risqué plot, which in of itself is hilarious, but these reluctant people need to realize that the sex is outweighed by the love, and the raunch outweighed by the righteousness. Zack & Miri Make A Porno is one of the best romantic comedies of the decade, as well as of the year. It\'s a fun, sweet, heartfelt raunchfest that will leave you laughing your ass off and having a good time. It\'s the perfect date movie if the person you\'re taking is receptive to the idea of seeing a movie like this.', ""For those who love the movies of Kevin Smith (the King of Bathos) as much as I do, it's important that you wait until you see the bluescreen before you leave the theater. That's right, watch the titles, wait *through* the color bar, and don't leave until you see the parental guidance screen (again). I'd be writing a spoiler if I told you why, but if you like this movie you'll want to keep watching till it's *all over*.This clearly is not a movie for prudes or anyone who can be offended by (in no order) making fun of gay people (in a friendly way), making fun of heterosexual people (in a friendly way), poop jokes, in fact, jokes about or show of any bodily function, including copulation, swearwords of any variety, making fun of sex, making fun of marriage, someone sitting on a toilet, um well, offended by just about anything. In fact, if you can be offended by anything except violence and intolerance, this movie is probably not for you.However, if you'd like some lighthearted fun about cappuccino-flavored love, and you like Kevin Smith's stuff, go for it."", 'Plot: Lifelong platonic friends Zack and Miri look to solve their respective cash-flow problems by making an adult film together. As the cameras roll, however, the duo begin to sense that they may have more feelings for each other than they previously thought.This is, probably, Kevin Smith\'s best movie since Clerks. A fresh new comedy about two friends and their urgency of money that makes them to do a porno movie. As usual in Smith, the film contains a lot of sexual discussion, nudity and, oh!, that vulgar language that makes the film even better. There\'s people that considers Kevin Smith a sick person. Because of the way he writes. But I consider him a genius! Even though I didn\'t liked, very much, his rated PG-13 movie. But, Clerks II was the relief of that cliché. Anyway, I mean this kind of movies makes you want to sit up your seat and go with him and tell: ""How do you come up with this sort of things? You\'re a genius, man!"". Seth Rogen, as usual, gives the funniest performance and he, I felt, that really was INTO the role. He really fitted in. I never imagine what other actor would be perfect for the character of Zack. And, well, Elizabeth Banks also has her greats. Unfortunately she doesn\'t go on full- frontal, but, still, she makes a perfect performance as Miri. Verdict: The best comedy of the 2008 and one of the best pictures of the year. Smith\'s best picture since Clerks. All Smith\'s fans will, surely, not be disappointed.

Judge Reinhold as the cuckold is okay- but the movie itself with its themes of degradation and revenge are not well done. But it is a good film for trivia contests- because so few people saw it.', ""In New Orleans, Zandalee (Erika Anderson) is married to poet-at-heart Thierry Martin (Judge Reinhold). He's struggling to keep afloat his father's business. Their marriage is in trouble. Childhood friend Johnny Collins (Nicolas Cage) comes back into his life after a bachelor party. Zandalee starts an affair with the wild painter Johnny.This is a lifeless movie. The stone-faced Erika Anderson lacks any kind of acting charisma. She was probably much better as a model. Her main contribution to the movie is nudity. Director Sam Pillsbury tries to inject nudity to spice up this tired melodrama. It doesn't work. The dialog is clunky as heck. The pace is as slow as molasses. This is sexploitation B-movie with a lot of great actors and Erika."", ""This is a great-looking film, filmed in rich colors and beautiful New Orleans locations. But dramatically it doesn't fare so well; it's mostly a monotonous series of heavy-breathing sequences, interrupted by dialogue passages that seem to exist only because a film can't be made ONLY with sex scenes. We also get lots of gratuitous nudity from the statuesque Erika Anderson, who's married to Judge Reinhold (fairly good, but not good enough to be taken absolutely seriously as a dramatic actor yet) and pursued by Nicolas Cage (in a smug performance he would probably like to forget today). Overall, not a horrible film, but not outstanding, either. (**)"", 'The movie is not as bad as the overall rating shows. I presume too many people saw it on account of Nicholas Cage and got disappointed. The problem is that the drama does not develop in one direction. It ended as a banal story about adultery culminating in a theatrical suicide and an unconvincing tragedy. Cage (Johnny), the outsider, turned up to be the guiltiest of all. Yet, until the middle the movie had developed around Anderson (Zandalee) and at some point it looked as if the victim of the drama would be exactly Cage who fell desperately in love with beautiful Anderson while she was using him to overcome her frustrations with husband Thierry. That seemed to be the purpose of the two supporting characters: Tatta and the gay shop-attendant who were pushing her into adultery, so as to save her marriage. At some point, either when shooting or when cutting, the concept changed and the triangle lost everything even remotely intriguing.', ""If you like nudity, I mean if you really, really, like nudity, this is one of the more frank nudist films I've seen. Some of it's nudity is naughty, for all you bird smugglers out there. Popular to belief, this is a bad film. It isn't. It's one of these arty, more unnoticed films, especially on Cage's resume. I've seen this film a lot. If you look past the nudity and appreciative helpings of sex, there is a story, but it's through this three characters in this love triangle, where for one, jealously goes beyond it's limit, another one, sadly in it's finale is a victim of circumstance I guess, while Cage, the other, in the end, is really the loser. He brings another crazy offbeat character that's mystifying in the form of a sleazy nude artist/university dropout/womanizer/part time magician, Johnny Collins. He's now back in the bayou working for his new boss, old school friend/gifted poet Reinhold, particularly good here, who speaks a southern accent, the way he delivers his poetry, he's just great. And so is his wife, Zandalee (Erika Anderson) not acting wise, just beautiful scenery. She doesn't even try to act, which must of been a worry. Joe Pantoliano, who almost trademarks character acting, is great as a cross dresser who works with Zandalee in her boutique. Soon Cage is getting in Anderson's pants, and it's almost as though Reinhold cracked onto this from the start, but you aren't sure, where he makes soft insinuations here and there, some through poetry. That's what I like about it, an incertitude, a scariness too, as what will Reinhold end up doing. Reinhold's a very tortured man of past, who gave the poetry up, as well as his performance in the bedroom, which is why Zandalee is drifting away from him and satisfying her sexual yearning from Cage in some pretty raunchy scenes. The prolonged last act of the film was interesting as that speedboat ride took a more than dangerous turn, but a real tragic one, evolved in the last breathing moments of the film, that was unforeseen, and truly climactic. For sex lovers, this one's sure not to disappoint, but there is more to this film than that, and that's not just in it's story. This is another of Cage's best performances among many.

Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara,3.5,4.5,"['Drama', 'Comedy', 'Romance']",Three friends decide to turn their fantasy vacation into reality after one of their friends gets engaged.,anticipation,"[""Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara is another film from Bollywood that is rip off of several Hollywood movies. There is nothing new in the theme of the movie and neither Zoya Khan has tried to present anything new. Plot is predictable and will remind you of several Hollywood movies like Bucket List, Hangover, Wild Hogs etc. It has taken several elements from the road trip movies of Hollywood therefore its not fun to watch the movie.If you have seen some of the finest road trip movies from Hollywood than you are not going to like Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. The acting of all the lead actors is good and you will like the movie if you haven't seen the movies mentioned above."", ""There is a fine line between good films and great films. Several times we have seen really good films falling short of being great films because the director and writer underestimate the intelligence of their audience and become too explanatory and narrative. As result of which, the story drags and audience lose interest. I might sound a bit harsh to the overall outcome of the effort of Zoya Akhtar but I believe this is exactly what happened with the highly anticipated Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (ZNMD). It has all the ingredients of becoming an all-time great film and it ends up being just another good film.It's inevitable to draw parallels with the great Dil Chahta Hai but it's unfair to do so. The only common thing is the lead trio and their bonding with each other but that's about it. I would personally consider it more on the lines of The Bucket List where the main characters break the shackles of their inner confines by doing things they have never done before but even The Bucket List has a different message altogether and is difficult to match.Besides being an excellent advertisement for tourism of Spain, ZNMD is a story of three lifelong friends going on a one-in-a-lifetime trip for the bachelor party, end up doing things which would make them look at their lives in a different way and inspire them to change the course of their lives by taking things in their own hands. Reema Kagti and Zoya Akhtar have a brilliant story. The first half is excellent but they fail to keep the screenplay tight enough in the second half. It becomes so lose at times that you start wondering how long it will take to finish a particular narrative.While educated humor, good acting, witty dialogue, amazing locations and cinematography work in favor of the film, there is always over-explanation for character building and communication of emotions that spoils the party. Hrithik is over ambitious, yes and it was understood from his intro scenes. There was no need of establishing this fact with seven sequences. It's a long film, almost three hours out of which sharp editing could have reduced the duration by twenty minutes. The song where Hrithik gives orgasmic expressions after being kissed (which obviously was not his first) is never ending. The skydive scene could have been shorter. Ditto for the bull race. Zoya the director was too lenient with the screenplay and editing.Farhan Akhtar has the biggest role in his acting career and he has managed it well. Excellent comic timing and fluency. Better than both his previous ventures. He also got a chance to recite some brilliant poems of his father but wasn't all that eloquent with that. Abhay Deol is the best among the three. It's almost his first big release and he has pulled it off in style. His pairing with Kalki also comes out nice after Dev D. Naseer was awesome in his cameo. A lesson for Hrithik. Naseer's role was also complicated and he only had ten minutes to convince everyone and he did what Hrithik could not in hours.On a personal level, I was slightly disappointed by Hrithik. The brilliant actor that he is, I would expect a lot more from him. Agreed, his character was a difficult one and he tried hard but he wasn't very convincing in the first half. I would also blame Zoya for that as I think she made a judgment error of giving total freehand to Hrithik and not challenging him enough. Katrina Kaif wastes some of the most inspiring lines of the film. Horrible dialogue delivery. She has been in the industry long enough to understand correct pronunciation of Hindi and the alibi of not knowing Hindi will not be valid anymore. Bad, bad, bad performance. The Hrithik Katrina pairing is also not the most comfortable one either. They don't look natural.Even though I have been quite negative in reviewing the film but this is mainly driven from the expectations this film carried. A film like this with less talented people would be awesome but when talent like Hrithik, Farhan, Abhay and Zoya are involved, one would expect another Dil Chahta Hai. Would ZNMD be an earner, probably yes\x85 Would it be an all-time classic, No."", 'take any Hindi movie where an actor is depressed/worried about sum baggage of his past life...he lives d entire movie trying to figure out how to deal with it...n he successfully does it by d end of d movie. u will find ample of such movies...take any 3 such stories.clip them, edit them n fit all 3 stories into 2hrs. put this against a backdrop of Spanish vacation...ban gaya ZNMD !!!well..yes. its that simple. but i gave it a 6 just fr d way they presented it. it was above average. also not to forget sum awesome stuff by javed akhtarP.S.

Is it my fault if the movie can be described in just 5 lines.....idiots', '""Seize the day"", is the whole and soul of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. I was actually quite low on expectations with this movie. But this movie has turned out to be a vagabond of friendship, love, adventure, emotions and above all, LIFE.I always believed that Farhan Akhtar is a good showman. Right from Rock On!!, Luck By Chance and the duh Kartik Calling Kartik. But this movie has proved it that he has all the elements that are needed in an actor. He can dance, can cry (can sing of course) and now, he can make you laugh. Abhay – Farhan – Hrithik are the three mesquiteers.Zoya Akhtar is one more reason to watch this movie. The way she directed Luck By Chance was not all serendipitous, and she has proved it. ZNMD is all her baby. The male bonding penned and filmed by her is pleasant. The Spanish locations are exotic. Dialogues (By Farhan Akhtar) are real and spontaneous. Movie runs with its own good slow pace, which is very much needed for the road movies. Many scenes halt the heart and literally put you on an adventure mode.Movie would have been a way better if songs were good. Editing needed a bit more stitch. I have no complaints regarding the length of the movie, as I can watch this Spanish odyssey for more than two hours with a tub of pop corn and a coke.Overall, this road movie is a trip to remember.', ""Zoya Akhtar's Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, through the lives of three friends, presents the world of contemporary Indian youth, who are successful, affluent yuppies. They just enjoy life because financially they have the means to do it. In mood and execution the film is very modern, light, yet it entails complex relationships in family and between friends. Essentially, in this regard, it has an uncanny resemblance to Dil Chahta Hai, though it's an altogether different film. The movie is non-sentimental and realistic, but it is emotional, and surprisingly enough, quite poetic. The dialogue by Farhan Akhtar is for the most part excellent.Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara is captivating, interesting and entertaining, and it captures the beauty of Spain with great mastery. At times this presentation is too perfect, but then it's a movie so that's what audiences want to see. It is beautifully shot, with an excellent cinematography working in its favour. The background score is very good, and the songs are very fun and catchy. All these aspects create a lyrical tone that is very uplifting to watch. Some scenes are just amazingly captured. The one when the guys get out of the water after diving, is pure magic. So is the one which shows them skydiving.The film is definitely not flawless, at least from my point of view. The main moral of the story, that life is only once and one should live it to the fullest, is successfully conveyed, generally speaking, but then at times it becomes over-repetitive and saccharine. Towards the second half, it looks like it tries hard to be inspiring and feels too larger-than-life, which it out of place in a film trying to portray realism. The ending is one such instance. Similarly, the friendship between the three leads, which is generally done well, often lacks the natural, understated camaraderie it requires (not because they fight, but in spite of it).Hrithik Roshan finally works as part of an ensemble cast where he doesn't have to carry a film all alone. He plays an imperfect man who grows as a character, and he does it ably. Farhan Akhtar is for the first time convincing and he's natural and enjoyable in a meaty role. Abhay Deol, as the flamboyant, playful guy who's unsure of whether he does or does not want to marry yet, is likable but still a bit of a disappointment. Deol is according to me the best actor of the three, based on what I've seen before, but in this film his character often lets him down--a sad case of weak writing--as it lacks true complexity.I never thought I'd say that, but Katrina Kaif is surprisingly effective and natural, and her part is actually very well written. Laila is lovely, kind, radial and, probably more importantly, is of mixed ethnicity, which makes her line delivery and accent justifiable and credible in this film. This may be the benefit, as it eases the work for Kaif, who, instead of focusing on her accent and Hindi line delivery (which was anyway poor), can for one concentrate on the character. She is never great, but she is good. Kalki is better in a smaller part. Speaking of small parts, Naseeruddin Shah and Deepti Naval, in just two brief scenes each, shine.Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara does partially bring forth another step in Hindi cinema's growth and departure from popular convention. It is thoroughly enjoyable, it has both style and substance, and though in my opinion it is nowhere an extraordinary film and is far from being really great, it is still a worthy and appreciable effort about living life to the fullest and cherishing every moment of it. Worth watching."", 'When was the last time you saw a feel good movie? When was the last time you laughed at simple silly conversations, when was the last time you remembered your bachelor days (only if you are married), when was the last time a movie made you think about your life, when was the last time a movie inspired you to enjoy the simple things in life, when was the last time a movie inspires you to let go off your fears..... Well not in the near past, definitely not from Bollywood. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara takes you through the simple moments of life, the life that every one miss out due to their busy schedule, commitments, etc..etc... and the movie does it through the life of three friends and their extended bachelor party trip. The beauty of the movie is that it concentrates on the life of the friends and how they let go their resistance to themselves and their fears rather than showing obscenity that normally rules movies which are based on bachelor party trips. Zoya does a fantastic job in making the viewers feel every part of the movie with a beautiful blend of nature, good camera work, good script and three gifted actors. There is not a moment in the movie which feels out of place, no songs which you feel is there to enhance the marketability of the movie, everything flows smoothly, everything blends so nicely which gives you the feel good factor that you expect from the movie. All the actors were fabulous and were perfect fit for the roles. To start in alphabetic order i will start with Abhay. What to say about this actor, he brings life to his roles and he has proved it over and over in his movies. I couldn\'t think about any actor who could have blended so well with the character in the movie like Abhay did. There is no replacement for him. I cant enhance on his character as it will give away the plot. The scenes where all the three friends make fun of people through their silly childhood act under the leadership of Abhay can only be carried out well by Abhay.Hritik is an actor who can do wonders when he lands the right roles. When even the new entrants avoids multi starrier movies, he has taken a role where other actors share more or less the same screen space, with no insecurity and no ego. In the movie you get to see a completely different Hritik, with a script which does not glorify him, he is just a friend among the three and he brings life to the movie with his charm and charisma. Farhan was bit of a surprise to me. He has grown as an actor from ""Rock on"" and ""Karthik calling Karthik"". I always found him to be more fit for a serious character than for the joker in the pack act. He does it extremely well. Probably its because of my prejudice that it was hard for me to take him in the role, but i had to let go my resistance.Katrina portrays a character which is similar to her real life, a mix breed of Indian and Brit, a freedom loving, ""live today"" kind of girl. Her combination with Hritik is electrifying. Kalki is such a good actress. Her expressions helps you relate well to the character. There is nothing to give out as a story, its all about three friends on a trip and trying out different things that they never tried before and how those things change there lives. But the beauty is in the details and climax. I think how the movie ends could have been better but song at the end of the movie with the credit makes up for it. Overall Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara impressed me and lived up to my expectation and above. I hope you would like the movie too. But \'hey\', everyone has different opinions, the general review by the critics for the last two movies i reviewed were totally against mine. So don\'t go for the review rather go for the movie and decide for yourselves.Read my reviews on the site www.Movierecycle.com', 'I have seen the film this morning and all the efforts put in are worth the movie. As expected, this is a good movie about grown up men and their emotional problems, which is naturally expected from the team that gave us Dil Chahta Hai and Rock On.A group of three friends (Hrithik, Abhay Deol and Farhan Akhtar) embark on a road trip in Spain as a part of a bachelor party for Abhay Deol, who is getting married to Kalki, and confused. Hritik and Farhan have their own personal issues too.The movie is a joy ride with subtle comedy. Farhan Akhtar\'s comic timing is impeccable. The comedy that was written just out of a ladies hand bag is too good.The wafer thin story line is beautifully put on screen with a superb screenplay. The performances are nothing less than your expectations with Hritik in the ensemble. Deepti Naval and Naseeruddin Shah add up to the list of artists.The movie portrays very heavy topics like marriage, love and Work. Yet, due to the sublime comedy you are never bored. I guess that is a mark of excellent script.Here is one line I want to pick up from this movie. Kalki says this line to Abhay Deol, her fiancé. ""You enjoy your bachelor trip. Aakhir shaadi ke baad you wouldn\'t feel like going around with your friends any more."" And you should see the expressions on the faces of the three guys...And yes, La Tomatina festival, Spainish beaches, and Katrina Kaif were a treat to watch.', ""Review in form of an open letter to Farhan Akhtar,Dear Farhan,You simply rock. As director you have created all brilliant films, your debut film Dil Chahta Hai is a cult film, which inspired all directors of India to make fresh looking light hearted urban films. Then came Lakshya, which was not commercially that successful, but was nevertheless a good film. Don, from which I expected nothing, hated the idea as the original starring Big B is one of my most fav Big B film, was splendid and established you as master. As producer, you have attempted fantastic films too. And now as an actor, you are getting better and better day by day. You rocked in Rock On, you were fantastic in LBC and KCK and in ZNMD too you have successfully stolen the show from my favorites Hrithik Roshan and Abhay Deol who have established themselves as good actors.Your role in the film is quite meatier and helps you stealing the show. Hrithik (whom you originally wanted to cast in DCH) is again fantastic in serious-all-business-minded-guy and changed-in-love-living-life-guy both. Abhay Deol is as always dependable, his tricks in the films are hilarious. Chemistry between you three is awesome. It feels like three real friends are on road trip.I hope you make sequel to this as producer, keeping Zoya on director's seat again, as I think, she was brilliant as director. She might have lived her life with lots of male friends as it not for a single moment seems like a film directed by lady director (which was the only minus point of LBC from my point of view). Hoping to see more from her.Dialogues are fantastic and makes one laugh, smile and think for sure. Story, Screenplay and Script are marvelous. Music is in rhythm with film's flow.All positive – No. Something minor which I found not-so-positive was Katrina's suitability for Laila's role and SEL's music. Katrina has done decent work compared to her past films, but fails to convince what her character needs to convince (and though I don't like Kariena that much, but I feel she suited for this role very much) though Hrithik being her counter part balances very well, and Hrithik and Katrina looks good together. SEL's music is not as great as their former films, though manages to please.Fav Moments in the film: Too many. Though listing some of them.1. Kabeer's all tricks 2. Imran's flirt with Laila and her friend 3. Imran's each funny comment 4. Imran – Arjun fights 5. Bagwati 6. Each Poetry recited by Imran 7. The moments which inspires those Poetries 8. In the Air Scenes 9. Imran & Salman's meeting 10. Imran & Arjun's meeting their after 11. Kabeer's Flashback 12. Arjun crying after Underwater 'Meditation'All and over, it's not DCH, it's not Rock On. Though, it has shades of both the films, but it's quite different story to tell and as it has many pleasing moments, one must watch it.A film fan – Hardik Raychanda""]",8,"['Drama', 'Comedy', 'Romance']"
Zombie Honeymoon,3.69,4.15,['Horror'],Zombie Honeymoon is a gore-soaked exploration of how far the boundaries of true love can be pushed without reaching a breaking point.,joy,"['After getting married, Danny (Graham Sibley) and Denise (Tracy Coogan) travel for a honeymoon of one month long in a cottage of her uncle nearby the beach. Danny and Denise are in deep love, and while they are resting on the beach, Danny is attacked by a stumbled zombie that comes out of the sea and vomits into his mouth. Danny dies for ten minutes, and when the doctor declares him dead, he miraculously revives. Danny stays in observation in the hospital along the night, and on the next morning, they leave the place and he convinces Denise to travel to Portugal. However, the former vegetarian Danny, having an uncontrollable hunger for human flesh, attacks many people, while Denise cleans his bloody mess trying to help her beloved husband.""Zombie Honeymoon"" is a bizarre and gore love story, but unfortunately the confused screenplay fails, once mixes romance, drama, dark comedy and horror but in very wrong doses and the genre of the story is not well situated. This low budget movie is visually too heavy and gore for a romance, shallow for a drama, silly for a comedy and most of the tension of the horror scenes are broken by the dramatic love story of Denise and Danny. The make-up and effects are great for this type of B-movie, and with improvements in the screenplay it would certainly be a cult-movie since it has a great potential. I believe ""Zombie Honeymoon"" deserves to be watched with a few expectations, and maybe the viewer may be favorably surprised. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Lua-de-Mel Assombrada"" (""Haunted Honeymoon"")', 'On the first day of the romantic honeymoon at the beach, a random zombie that comes stumbling out of the ocean infects Danny with an incurable virus. After being dead for a full ten minutes, he miraculously awakes and even continues planning his emigration to Portugal with his beloved bride Denise. But Danny really isn\'t the same anymore, as his insatiable hunger for human flesh drives him to forcefully attack people while Denise \x96 loving wife as she is \x96 helps him get rid of the leftover corpses. For only his second film as a writer slash director, Dave Gebroe had the bizarre ambition to blend gross horror with genuine romantic drama and even to throw in bits of comedy. The idea is admirable but, as you can imagine, the result is an often lacking and pathetic film. You can\'t really expect a story to emotionally affect you while you\'re watching at a slowly rotting zombie that takes large bites of flesh out of people, right? Luckily for me, I saw this film at a national festival where Gebroe himself came to enlighten the audience about his motivations and influences to make it. Believe it or not, but that actually helped me appreciating the effort slightly more! The whole dramatic aspect of the story is apparently based on a real event, as the director\'s brother-in-law tragically died in a surfing accident, which left his young wife behind with an emotional trauma. Re-working bits and pieces of this real-life drama into a horror film served as some sort of therapy for Gebroe, who was really fond of his brother-in-law as well. However, even with bearing Gebroe\'s introduction in mind, ""Zombie Honeymoon"" can\'t possibly pass for a good film. The sentimental moments are painfully tedious whereas the zombie action is quite gore and explicit. These sudden changes in tone are difficult to process and especially the tongue-in-cheek gags entirely miss their effect. The make-up effects are rather convincing considering the fairly low budget and the acting performances are spirited. The music selection and exterior filming locations; both a homage to the deceased Danny as well, are winning elements too.', ""I just saw this last night. Although it has some really strong points--the lead actress especially--it was ultimately disappointing. The problem is that the director didn't settle on a single genre. It could have been a solid quirky comedy like SHAUN OF THE DEAD--there are some very funny scenes. But there are also really intense scenes that don't mesh with the comedy.If the decision had been made to make a totally serious emotional film--what do you do when your new husband turns into a flesh-eating zombie?--but the comic scenes undercut that intensity.Or it could have been a great mindless gore film--and there's plenty of great gore here. This film has plenty of good elements, but it just doesn't hold together.I will definitely check out whatever this director does next."", 'I was as surprised by the quality of this indie outing as I was by finding it in my public library in the first place. None of the principals involved seem to have gone much of anywhere in the past few years, but that\'s no slur on the integrity of this admirable little piece of cult film-making.I suspect many of the negative commentaries posted here are from people who expected something more directly related to the Romero/Argento zombie mythos. That\'s not what this very personal story is concerned with, and more power to it. Instead, what we get is what we might expect given the title: a romantic tale of true love between a blushing new bride and her unfortunately zombified groom. Well actually, the groom doesn\'t do the undead two-step until after they\'re married, but who\'s to quibble? Well written and shot with only a few naff scenes, ""Zombie Honeymoon"" features very respectable performances from a cast of unknowns, especially Tracy Coogan as the young woman who has no trouble getting her husband to eat leftovers, particularly if they\'re human. Graham Sibley as the hubby turns in a good showing as well, although at times he seemed a bit too fey. The rest of the cast achieves various levels of believability, but overall the ensemble is far superior to that of, say, ""Undead."" I won\'t say this is as clever or engaging as ""Shaun of the Dead,"" which plants itself firmly in Romeroland, but it\'s definitely worth a cheap rental or a lucky borrow at the library. I had to give it a ""6"" just for the quality that ended up on the screen.Put it this way: with a little bit of script-tweaking and a higher production budget, along with the casting of marketable names, ""Zombie Honeymoon"" could have been a true classic. As it is, it\'s still a very watchable film and I hope that Mr. Gebroe is able to find further work in the industry. His talent and passion are more than evident. I also hope Ms. Coogan pops up again somewhere down the line, because she\'s not only a cutie, she\'s got some acting chops that aren\'t typically seen in indie films like this one. I\'d say her greatest weakness is that she looks like too many other young actresses without having her own distinctive edge. Still, she\'s young, and with a little luck may well earn herself a worthy career. She has my best wishes, that\'s for sure.', 'I saw this at the Torino Film Festival a couple of months ago.The director introduced the movie before the screening. He\'s a nice New Jersey guy, who almost could not believe he had been invited to Torino with his second feature film (the first one\'s title is called ""The Homeboy"" and it is briefly seen here in a funnily self-deprecating scene at a video-rental (a furious client returns it to the clerk and yells his money back - but he has to pay for returning it late). ""Zombie Honeymoon"", said the director, ""is probably the first zombie-movie ever to be based on personal experience"".The audience was ready to laugh, but there was nothing funny about that: the plot is an effort to handle the untimely demise of the director\'s brother-in-law, who died in a surfing accident shortly after getting married. The premise of the movie, therefor, is telling the story of two people trying to remain together against all possible odds.The film\'s protagonist, Danny, is a surfer as well - but what gets him (temporarily) killed is not an accident: like a rotting pal of Venus Anadiomene, a zombie walks out from the sea to directly attack the poor guy and vomit black goo straight into his mouth. Then he falls dead over him. Rushed unconscious to the hospital, our hero also dies, only to come back to life a few minutes later. Problem is, after coming back home he finds himself desperately hungry for human flesh - which understandably proves a shock to his young wife Denise.While presenting the film, Gebroe introduced it as a cross between a John Cassavetes piece and ""Night of the Living Dead"" - which is a fitting description for ""Zombie Honeymoon"". Although the photography does leave a lot to be desired (the film is all shot on digital video, and the choice of a hand-held camera style proves somewhat a bit annoying instead of contributing to the realistic effect ), the dialog and the interaction between the two unfortunate newlyweds are all absolutely believable - and even moving at times. Graham Sibley (Danny) is OK, but the selling point to the film is Tracy Coogan\'s Denise - not only she\'s beautiful: she is also great in totally selling the story.Maybe the film does lose some steam halfway through, when the gruesome suppers of Danny start becoming a little repetitive. However, the final 20 minutes are genuinely poignant - starting with a great scene where Danny, after eating some of his victims, spends a long time in the dark of his and Denise\'s home playing with one of those arcade games from the 80s, while Denise, devastated, comes close to him and watches him play the game without uttering a single word.I won\'t spoil the ending of the best zombie romance since the underrated ""Return of the Living Dead III"", but any Blues Brothers fan should love the way Gebroe uses the song ""Sometimes is Hard to be a Woman"" - we sure kept humming it for the rest of the evening, while discussing if death couldn\'t be seen as the ultimate handicap. Do check this film out, it\'s worth your while.', ""I thought the lead character played by Tracy Coogan was excellent. The entire cast was very cute and charming. I liked the serious tone, taken by the movie. It took itself, very seriously, which added to the humor. A very good B movie, in my opinion. There were a few moments, that were very scary. The background music was good, and the song in the ending credits, was just right.I wish Drive-in's were still around, this movie would be perfect for that. I have seen quite a few B movies recently and this was my favorite. With the romance, good looking characters, and dark humor, this is a minor classic. Mark"", 'I disagree with the above comment in that I don\'t think there needs to be a choice between completely serious and completely comedic. I think the fact that it had elements of both was its strong point. Why make another predictable piece of crap when you can mix it up and touch viewers on multiple levels? Movies that are complete satire, like Shaun of the Dead, have very little intellectual depth and tend to be ""dumbed down."" Completely serious dramas can be a little TOO intense without some comic relief. Most dramas have at least SOME comedy mixed in anyway. To me, the balance of those elements makes a good movie. And I think Zombie Honeymoon was great as is. Most zombie movies are predictable, but this one was different for many reasons. Great soundtrack too!', ""One part romantic story with charming characters and pathos, one part flesh chewing action. The two genres shouldn't work together particularly well, but they do a very good job of it here. The romance is sweet without being saccharine, the zombie 'snacking' is gory but not repulsive. This genre clashing is balanced by a deft dark comic touch, leading to one of the more interesting zombie efforts of recent years. Zombie Honeymoon is held together by its balanced tone, and production values on a budget. The acting is of a high standard, particularly Tracy Coogans wife 'Denise', giving the film an emotional resonance lacking some zombie films. The film has an excellent garage / surfer rock soundtrack (one of the credited roles was for 'Psychobilly Adviser'), and excellent sound design - it sounds like their having a lot of fun in the production of this element.Its main flaw, an unfortunately unavoidable one, is that it doesn't strictly adhere to the zombie rule book (handed down to us by the one they call Romero), making comprimises between the zombie and romance genres (a few more zombies wouldn't have gone amiss), and there are a few unanswered questions lingering on later viewing. Thankfully, the film is enjoyable enough whereby it's not too much of a challenge to overlook these points. This film is destined to be a cult favourite; it isn't for everyone, but its good to know that these two conflicting genres can work together. An accompany piece to Shaun Of The Dead or Bubba Hotep is not unfair to say. Zombie Honeymoon is a genuinely sweet, fun, unique, and interesting film, treading between binary opposite genres skillfully."", ""Well, there's no shortage of zombie movies out there, so it's good that someone decided to make one with a difference! David Gebroe's film, apparently exploring the boundaries of true love, may not be as original as it would seem to some horror fans - the crappy Nekromantik used a similar theme to portray the same thing, while zombies and love have met before in the brilliant Dellamorte Dellamore, but Zombie Honeymoon is at least a departure from the usual zombie film. It's true that not everything about the film works, but I'm pretty sure it was never meant to be a masterpiece. The plot focuses on enthusiastic newlyweds Denise and Danny. They go down to the beach for a bit of sunbathing, and then their honeymoon turns into a nightmare when a strange man appears from the sea and vomits in Danny's mouth! After dying for ten minutes, Danny comes round, but it soon transpires that the man from the sea had some sort of disease and now it's passed on to Danny. He develops a taste for human flesh and his body begins to decay...but Denise sticks by him.Rather than focus on the areas where the film is lacking, I'd rather focus on the good parts! It's not often that a new horror film takes me by surprise, so I don't want to say too many bad things about Zombie Honeymoon. The base plot - revolving around the newly weds provides a good base for the story. As Danny descends further into his illness, we can feel bad for the couple considering their earlier happiness and plans. The horror is given an extra layer by way of gore! I won't say that the gore too over the top, but director David Gebroe doesn't exactly hold back and there's plenty of splatter to please the gorehounds. The zombie make-up is quite good too as it feels very old school, which gives the film more credibility than, say, the Dawn of the Dead Remake. The plot sometimes does seem contrived and the leading pair of actor's don't always convince the audience that they're fully in love; but the film works in spite of that, and from start to finish; Zombie Honeymoon is a damn good little zombie film and I definitely give it high recommendations!"", 'In a genre so inundated with formulaic, excessively grotesque ""can you top this"" shock-gore, I found this movie to be a welcome addition to the Zombie annals. Really, if you think about this, no one has attempted to do what Gebroe has done--create a dramatic/romantic zombie film. There have been elements in others, but no one has shot this high before. First of all, what made this movie work for me, was that I bought the love story. This is a credit to both Gebroe\'s writing and the actors. Not only do I not agree with the venomous accusation put forth by the immature hate-mongers that the characters/performances were ""flat"", I was truly surprised at how believable and charming the characters were. In the world of Indies, performances in movies with a Digital format have a nasty habit of looking transparent (maybe it\'s the loss of the beautiful illusion conjured by the depth and saturation of 35mm). In this movie, however, Graham and Tracy make the love real between Danny and Denise, with none of the affectations that could have prevented this from coming across. I even liked David Wallace\'s ""Buddy"" and Tonya Cornelisse\'s ""Nikki"". Sure, they\'re campy best-friend fixtures, but there\'s a refreshing likability about their performances. The real treasure of this flick, and the most intriguing genre aspect is the progression of Danny\'s necrosis and how it is strikingly captured in both the direction, performance(s) and special effects. Graham Sibley\'s Danny is frighteningly accurate--rarely do we see an attempt to humanize someone undergoing this horrific metamorphosis. The apologetic tone in his voice when he\'s pleading with Denise to help him is absolutely sincere. And the scene around the toilet bowl is almost as emotionally painful as it is revolting. Tracy\'s (Denise\'s) reactions to Danny\'s downward spiral have the authentic desperation of someone who is manically trying to shield themselves from a hideous truth. It\'s like being married to a drug-addict or someone who is mentally ill--you love them so goddamn much, you can\'t bring yourself to admit the presence of their destructive pathos. From a Direction standpoint, the movie is remarkably sharp. It starts slowly, but builds such a palpable amount of tension, you find yourself short of breath at certain points. The last 45 minutes are as thrilling as anything I\'ve seen in the last year. The scene where he\'s standing there, playing R.B.I. baseball with those soul-less, impassive eyes...it\'s unnerving watching someone\'s life force slowly being drained from them. The textured, psychological use of the mirrors in the Bedroom during the tense climax scene. The subtlety used in conveying Danny\'s increasingly conflicted view of Denise--helplessly trying to maintain the last vestige of his old self and the love they shared while trying to silence the demoniacal sublime satisfaction offered by devouring her flesh. Admittedly, I am a big fan of contemporary genre revision, so I am not surprised why I liked this movie so much. Whether it\'s Altman with McCabe and Mrs. Miller or Polanski with Chinatown, the prospect of working within a familiar genre blueprint and still managing to transcend those narrow constraints usually makes for compelling cinema. Zombie Honeymoon observes this revisionist recipe quite well. And while it may not be (or pretend to be) either of those films mentioned above and Mr. Gebroe may not be on the level of Polanski and Altman yet, there is certainly an abundance of talent evident in this film and a bright future for those involved. And, yes, in agreement with previous postings, I believe that ""fofamreturns"" and ""rise4289"" (the negative responses to this film) are one in the same person. The mis-spelling of ""waist"" and the dual use of the ""12-year old analogy"" clearly give that away...empty negative rhetoric from malicious people is nothing new in IMDb, but it is still just as infuriating and unnecessary.', ""Horror films have always had the 'notch above adult films' stigma, usually used due to an overabundance of splattery special effects and weak(er) acting, usually sacrificed in the service of the former. There's no reason a horror film cannot tick all the boxes of what we've come to expect in the genre, still frighten and disturb us, and not have something to say AND have fleshed-out characters populating it.Dave Gebroe was smart and jumped on this deficit in the horror genre..aside from Larry Fessenden and maybe Brad Anderson and Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, horror films and 'emotional' rarely end up in the same sentence. Dave takes a more dramatic approach to a scary movie. If John Cassavetes was hired to do a zombie film it might be something like this, although the director pours the energy of youth into this film and his leads.Using an intentionally lurid yet appropriate title to lure us in, the film covers the once vibrant and now deteriorating marriage of Danny and Denise, two psychobilly-crazed, frenetic and all-out happy lovers who are rushing from the altar, newly wed. This euphoric approach, followed by a hilarious scene where they get to their new house, drop everything and start planning to live abroad, sweep us up in the giddy rush of starting a new life with the one who makes your heart sing.Naturally, because he remembers it's a horror film, things go wrong ten minutes later.A decaying surfer stumbles out of the ocean and 'infects' Danny who seemingly dies on the operation table an hour later. But a few minutes after that, he's up and feeling OK, if a bit pale. And hungry...While we do get all the standard trappings we'd hope for (flesheating carnage), the real and welcome focus is on how Denise copes with her husband's deterioration into something else. An amped-up similarity to THE FLY aside, it's all about devotion to one's significant other. This one's worth checking out. Who knew horror movies knew how to be heartbreaking as well?"", ""I'd imagine that it's not easy to make a poignant zombie movie. Only a handful of filmmakers have pulled it off, and even then the poignancy was sometimes hidden behind or inextricable from the gore, humor, nudity, or surrealism. With Zombie Honeymoon, writer/director Dave Gebroe succeeded in crafting a film that is accessible as well as meaningful, blackly humorous, deliciously gory, and honestly emotional.Zombie Honeymoon's exploration of love and loss is alternately heartrending, gut wrenching, gut munching, and gut splitting. The story follows newlyweds Denise and Danny (cathartically based on Gebroe's real-life sister and late brother-in-law) as their honeymoon is interrupted by an attack by a zombie. In the tradition of Romero and some other classics, the zombie's existence and targeting of Danny are never really explained; in this case, it drives home just how arbitrary personal tragedies can seem. People die randomly all the time, but no one ever expects it to happen to someone they love.Danny does die, but mysteriously revives shortly afterward. Things aren't quite back to normal, however, especially once Danny begins to manifest an insatiable hunger for human flesh. With the new cravings and the physical deterioration that we've come to associate with zombies, Danny's ghoulish transformation carries with it evident parallels to issues of addiction and disease. And suddenly there is a host of new logistical problems that Danny and Denise must face as a new married couple trying to stay together, plan for the future, and keep Danny from killing and eating too many people.This isn't the first Zombeo-and-Juliet movie, but it may be the best yet. Gebroe handles the concept adeptly, maintaining a subtle level of dark humor without allowing the film to lapse into sheer silliness (which would have been very easy for it to do, given the almost satirical premise). Zombie Honeymoon is more Zombie-Romantic-Tragedy than Zom-Rom-Com, but still delivers its share of laughs and even uplifting moments.A quick word about the leads: Graham Sibley and Tracy Coogan bring great realism to their roles as the newlyweds. They are convincing in making the transition from enthusiastic, lovestruck naiveté to shock, frustration, desperation, fear, sadness... and hunger. As their relationship becomes strained, the way they push each other away even as they cling to each other really rings true, even in the midst of some seriously blood-drenched moments.Overall, a fine film."", ""I saw this movie in New York and loved it! And, it was not just me, the audience actually clapped during the credits. Although it is a zombie flick, it is surprisingly romantic. The acting was top notch, and the directing was very professional. I will definitely check out Gebroe's next movie. While one would expect some lulls during a zombie flick, I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie. I can't wait to go the Jersey Shore (but there is no way I am going in the water!). I highly recommend this movie to everyone. Like I said, it is not just a zombie movie. This movie rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""]",13,['Horror']
Zookeeper,3.16,3.25,"['Comedy', 'Romance', 'Family']","A group of zoo animals decide to break their code of silence in order to help their lovable zookeeper find love, without opting to leave his current job for something more illustrious.",joy,"['If you are about to ask me what possessed me in seeing Zookeeper, my answer would be curiosity. At first, I wasn\'t sure whether I wanted to see Zookeeper. The cast in general didn\'t appeal to me, apart from Nick Nolte and Rosario Dawson, and the trailer in the cinema when I went to see Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 had me cringing.When I eventually dragged myself to see Zookeeper I was overall very unimpressed. Is it the worst movie of the year? Not quite, that would be either Big Momma 3, River of Darkness or Spy Kids 4. But it is low on my ""films I saw in 2011"" list.I know Zookeeper is a family movie, I get that. But in my book, just because it\'s a family movie, doesn\'t automatically mean it\'s a good movie. Just for the record, I love family movies, some of my favourites are family movies, such as Disney, Pixar, movies like The Wizard of Oz, The Secret Garden, A Little Princess, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, ET, Black Beauty and The Black Stallion. Zookeeper just isn\'t my idea of a good family movie that\'s all.I love family movies that touch you and reach out to the child within you, and also ones that appeal to a wide audience. Of course Zookeeper isn\'t that type of movie, but family movies can also entertain. I admit I raised a smile once or twice, mainly because of Bernie the Gorilla, and the movie didn\'t make me cringe as much as its trailer did, but overall Zookeeper just didn\'t entertain me.Firstly, the writing is pretty much a mess. Not only is the script poorly written and a vast majority of the gags predictable and cringe worthy, but to me the humour would go over the heads of most kids and adults would find it childish.The storyline is also incredibly predictable, and while some of the final act felt rushed a lot of it because of the humour not working felt dull. Not only that, it is very unoriginal, not always a problem, but seriously just how many times have we had the Dr Doolittle/talking animals idea? I did like some of the scenery and the animals do look great. The editing however could\'ve been much tighter. The music is forgettable and doesn\'t always fit with the mood, and the direction is plodding and unfocused.I do wish there was better news about the acting, but sadly no. I am not a fan of Kevin James, though I wasn\'t going to let that spoil the movie experience. However because his character so clichéd and material so weak, James tries too hard and overdoes it, badly. Rosario Dawson is pretty much wasted in a thankless role.The animals are in a way more interesting than the humans, they look fine and their material somewhat funnier. Voice work is more problematic, some do decently but some grate fast. Adam Sandler and Maya Rudolph are incredibly irritating, while Sylvester Stallone sounds bored. Cher tries her best but her character is not among the most interesting. The best, and the only one I really did like, was Nick Nolte as Bernie.Overall, messy and doesn\'t work in my opinion. 2/10 Bethany Cox', 'Kevin James plays Griffin Keyes, an average guy in an average job. He has a kind heart and an above average ability to relate to the animals in his care as the zookeeper of The Franklin Park Zoo in Boston.The film opens with Griffin breaking up with his long time girlfriend Stephanie (Leslie Bibb). He weathers the disappointment and we fast forward 5 years where Griffin has now become the head zookeeper. At a celebration of his brother\'s upcoming wedding, Griffin spots Stephanie and his old feelings for her bubble to the surface. Lost and confused Griffin\'s animal buddies come to his rescue by 1 - letting him in on the secret that animals can communicate with humans (in English no less) and 2 - teaching him how to win the female of his species (advice that may be better left as that - advice) Some physical humor and not so funny scenes and lines fill out the movie for the long 104 minutes. Rosario Dawson plays Kate, the obvious new love interest for Griffin.Unless you\'re between the ages of 8 and 12 leave this one unseen - I don\'t even think it is worth the matinée price. Maybe catch it some time when it has been ""formatted to fit this screen"" and ""shortened to fit in the time allotted"".', 'Zookeeper (1:42, PG) — Other: talking animals, 3rd string, originalSince I had almost nothing good to say about Transformers: Dark of the Moon, you may have wondered why I rated it as high as 3. Wonder no more. I had to leave room below it for a real blackboard-scratcher like Zookeeper.Let me dispose of the good stuff first. (It won\'t take long.) The animatronic and matchmove (mouth looking like it\'s actually speaking the words) techies had it down cold. (However, this was undercut by the animals mainly just standing around and not doing anything.) The novelty voice casting was effective, with Cher as Janet the lioness, Sylvester Stallone as Joe the lion, and especially gruff, gravelly Nick Nolte as Bernie the lonely gorilla.Now for the rest of the movie, which was unrelentingly, squirmingly embarrassing, wall to wall, end to end. The 3 opening minutes feature beefy, inarticulate slob Kevin James, as lovestruck zookeeper Griffin Keyes, making a huge production out of his beachy proposal to Stephanie (Leslie Bibb), in her not-so-secret identity as Vacuous Girl. She refuses the offer, but the mere fact that either of these losers ever saw anything at all in the other instantly alerts you to the avalanche of bad judgment which is about to befall all concerned, notably including anybody who didn\'t actually TAKE money to sit thru the movie.The rest of the plot occurs 5 years later, as Griffin gets a 2nd shot at VG. As he moons and stutters over her yet again, the surrounding zoo animals (who think he\'s a really good guy and don\'t want to lose him) remind each other of their code: ""We don\'t EVER talk to humans."" Given the expectations for the audience\'s attention span, this code is predictably violated within 2 minutes. Thereafter, the critters try to coach him in getting the girl. Given that this tends to run more to, um, mating than courting, they load him up with such helpful advice as ""lead with your pudding sack"", mark your territory the wolvish way, and (from the world\'s least endearing monkey) ""throw the poop"". Imagine a checklist of disgusting bodily functions (boogers, poop, pee, etc.) and make sure there\'s at least 1 checkmark next to each of them before you\'re done. (Wait! Did we miss puke? Nope, there it is, right on schedule.)Poor Rosario Dawson gets stuck with the thankless role as the nice, understanding eagle lady Kate, who would be the perfect soulmate for Griffin if only he weren\'t such an idiot, and if she subtracted about 5,393 licks of sense.Rupert Gregson-Williams generates a giddy, slappy-sappy-happy score to keep pace with the merry hijinks.There are 5 credited screenwriters — Nick Bakay, Rock Reuben, Kevin James, Jay Scherick, and David Ronn — and dividing the 102-minute run time 5 ways leads me to believe that each of them independently wrote 20 minutes worth of plot without consulting the others, then they flipped coins to decide the sequence in which the disparate components would be assembled. Lurking elsewhere in the credits is the info that this is a Happy Madison production, meaning that the dreaded Curse of Adam Sandler was probably hovering over the entire debacle from the get-go.My condolences to Boston\'s Franklin Park Zoo, which I\'m sure is a perfectly fine institution, for having its reputation sullied by its willingness to provide the settings.I\'ve said many bad things about this movie, but you\'ll notice it still got a 2. There\'s room to go even lower. ""How can this be?"", you are probably wondering. 2 words: Smurfs. Chipmunks. If you\'d like to get me a nice Xmas present, I chamber .44-caliber rounds; 1 will suffice.', 'Hidden in the concrete jungle is New York Zoo with Griffin Keyes (Kevin James), its zoo-keeper, the heart of the facility. Meanwhile - unbeknownst to the outside world - the zoo is inhabited by talking giraffes, elephants, monkeys, lions and the like. When Keyes former girlfriend Stephanie (Leslie Bibb) threatens to throw him into a depression relapse the animals decide to make a coming out and assist their zoo-keeper with advice in the matters of the heart.Overly obscene and borderline disgusting littered with senseless jokes spurted out by gibberish animals, ""Zookeeper"" fails to deliver in one key aspect: making you laugh. Albeit Leslie Bibb and Rosario Dawson do add some flair to the proceedings with their ueber-stereotypical one dimensional characters James lacks enough comedic flair to pull off the lone hero role, while crude animals with moronic lines hardly help his case. Foreseeably James manages to get his girl with the use of animal advice, but the same won\'t help him draw in any audience.', 'Kevin James (""The Dilemma"") is in his element in ""Zookeeper"" portraying a very familiar character and is even more likable than before. Therefore, Director Frank Coraci (""Click"") centers the film around Smith\'s slapstick comedy to salvage a poorly written script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn (""Norbit""). Horid scriptwriting commences as James\'s character Griffin Keyes proposes and rejected by his girl friend Stephanie (Leslie Bob, ""Iron Man 2"") solely on the basis that he was a zookeeper. Five years later, he is more dedicated than ever to the zoo animals, but is still trying to get over her. He has a new woman in his life named Kate (Rosario Dawson, ""Unstoppable""), an animal doctor at the zoo, but is too infatuated with his past to read the signs. Meanwhile, Griffin is trying to connect with the zoo\'s Gorilla Bernie, but is having no luck. Stephanie then reenters his life looking to change Griffin once again. Griffin is determined to do anything to win her back. However, she is in a complicated relationship with a man named Gale (Comedian Joe Rogan) causing Griffin to have to compete for Stephanie\'s attention. He has no idea where to start until the animals at the zoo give him advice after breaking their biggest rule of not talking to humans. With a little added help from Kate he gets very close to changing his personality for good, but realizes in the end that he is meant for bigger and better things. Ken Jeong (""The Hangover: Part II"") and Donnie Wahlberg (CBS\'s ""Blue Bloods"") also star as zookeeper in this film.James has the clear stand out performance, but is strongly supported by an all-star comedic voice cast including Nick Nolte (Bernie the Gorilla), Adam Sandler (Donald the Monkey), Cher (Janet the Lioness), Sylvester Stallone (Joe the Lion) Judd Apatow (Barry the Elephant), Jon Favreau (Jerome the Bear) and Faizon Love (Bruce the Bear). Each animal is personified entertainment in their own way; however, the pair of bears conjure the most laughs. Kids will enjoy the childish predictable plot while older viewers will only be interested in the unlikely friendship that forms between Griffin and Bernie the Gorilla creating a hint of sentiment in the film.With two of the worst scriptwriters in Hollywood responsible for its screenplay it is not a surprise that after the exposition of the film there isn\'t any reason to pay attention to the story. Henceforth, the conclusion is inevitably predictable, but Director Coraci evidently wanted to telegraph it even more. Leslie Bob\'s poor acting and portrayal of Stephanie as a horrible human being make it completely obvious that Griffin will never be with her. The biggest indicator of mediocrity comes in the form of ""The Hangover"" and ""Community"" favorite Ken Jeong as he skates through the movie on the track to pointlessness.First ""Mall Cop"", now ""Zookeeper"" brings up the question of what odd profession James will tackle next. What ever it is James will do a solid job, lets just hope horrid writers aren\'t following him around in his next kids story adventure.', ""Griffin Keyes (Kevin James) is the perfect employee. In addition to being the favorite of all the animals at the Franklin Park Zoo, he's professional, courteous and well-liked by his co-workers. His dedication was only compounded when, five years earlier, he was dumped by his fiancée mid-proposal. But when his fiancée (Leslie Bibb) comes back into his life at his brother's engagement party, his career soon feels like an albatross around his neck. Fearing the loss of their favorite zookeeper, the animals (voiced by Sylvester Stallone, Nick Nolte, Cher and others) intervene. They reveal the fact that they can speak and always could and then proceed to offer Griffin whatever help they can in winning back his former girlfriend. The attempts and advice vary in detail but what it all amounts to is a slapstick tsunami. It can enhance a storyline when used correctly but the use of it in this film is meant to replace one. It makes for a lot of laughs, but not a lot of originality. Basically, if you've seen the commercial, you've seen the movie. The kids will enjoy it, you might too, but you'd like it just as much if you waited to rent the DVD."", 'So maybe you hated Paul Blart: Mall Cop. Maybe you\'re sick of Kevin James in The King of Queens. Maybe you saw the trailer and thought, ""Night at the Museum rip-off!"" right after you thought, ""This is a joke, right?"" I will admit that I held all of these accusations against Zookeeper when I entered the theater, but one thing I\'ve learned is that preemptive decisions to not see a comedy simply because you think you have a grudge against it is BAD BAD BAD. I can understand if people can\'t stand Kevin James\'s frenetic humor IF YOU WATCHED IT, but over 400 votes of ""1 star"" a week before the movie is even released shows some shameful attitudes among IMDb voters. Purposeful down-voting is never justified, and is especially a disservice to Zookeeper, which actually turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Roger Ebert put it best when he said: ""Look, a great movie this is not. A pleasant summer entertainment it is."" The moments that make an awful comedy awful are the ones when you feel like burying your face in your hands and wishing you never saw a second of this movie. You can all think of those times, I\'m sure. Personally, Zookeeper NEVER gave me one of those moments. The plot was a breath of innocent fresh air and managed to keep me interested in the movie. The romantic tensions in Paul Blart: Mall Cop were ridiculously exaggerated, but in Zookeeper were quite low-key. The same goes for Kevin James\'s boyish, frenetic acting; James has an inherent likability about him that really carries the weight of the film. Be it puppets, animation, or real animal movement, the zoo animals were impressive as well and sported some convincing lip-dialogue sync that you wouldn\'t expect to find in a movie like this. With a varied cast that will keep you guessing at who voices who, the animals are the second great half of the show. This is a family film aimed at innocent, happy-go-lucky moviegoers and you know it - so if you\'re looking at a pleasant and light time at the theater, Zookeeper is the one to check out this weekend. But if you want the typical Hollywood explosions, then grab three extra dollars and head down to see Transformers 3 in 3D instead.', 'After seeing the film at an advanced screening, I have to admit that this is one of the films to be put into the Kevin James hall of fame along with Hitch and Paul Blart. The film was a decent amount of laughter and the trailer does say a lot about the film. In ""Zookeeper"", Kevin James gives one of the greatest performances of his career as Griffin Keyes who is, you probably guessed, a zookeeper. Griffin asks Stephanie (Leslie Bibb) to marry him, but she rejects his proposal because she\'s embarrassed that he\'s a zookeeper. Five years pass and Griffin is still a zookeeper when he runs into Stephanie again and begins his quest to win her back. The animals of Franklin Park Zoo band together and reveal to Griffin that they can talk in an effort to keep him from leaving. To get him to stay, they decide to teach him how to win the girl.The film was a huge success to me and I do recommend it as a family comedy. I give it a 7/10.', 'After reading some of the reviews for this movie, it is absolutely clear that most of the previous reviewers didn\'t get the point of the movie. It is a FAMILY movie. You don\'t go to movies to see what you can pick apart, and then write a review that is already predisposed negatively against it. That\'s just stupid. Anyone who goes into a movie with the attitude they are going to hate the movie no matter, and writes an extremely negative review is an idiot. The reason to go to movies is to be entertained.Zookeeper was a movie that entertained. The performances by all the cast members were very well done. There were a lot of laughs, and there was a lot of fun. My son, who by the way is 7, was in the perfect demographic for this movie. It had interesting characters, and situations.For an adult, a movie with talking animals might not be your cup of tea, but for a small child, it is awesome. Yes, a child thinks it\'s funny when someone smashes into something or someone. Yes, for an adult, the movie might seem predictable, but truthfully, what movie isn\'t somewhat predictable? A young child (for whom the movie was made for) isn\'t going to be scrutinizing every tiny, single thing in a movie, just to say, "" A-HA! SEE, I KNEW IT!"". A child goes to the movies to be lost in imagination. My son laughed when there was a funny part. Whether it was funny because of the animals, or the humans, I heard a lot of laughter. And yes, I laughed a lot too, and so did my wife. I believe that anyone who goes into this movie with the understanding that this is a movie targeted towards families with young children, that they will be entertained. This movie hits the mark for the appropriate audience members it was made for.', 'After reading some of the unfair reviews this film has received I felt compelled to add my two cents. Yes it\'s a formula film, yes we\'ve all seen it before, yes you can see the plot coming a mile away.Honestly, I expected to hate this film... I\'m not a big fan of the lead and I normally do not like these types of films, but 30 minutes in I was won over (maybe it was all the animals). This is a light-hearted family film and should be taken for what it is. If you have kids, they will absolutely love it.The big name actors voicing the animals was a pleasant surprise and the animal animation and ""acting"" was very believable.A very enjoyable film.', ""Me and my family just watched this and it is a great family fun movie. I ain't no hater like some people and just see things for what they are. I laughed, the missus laughed and hey my parents laughed as well as the kids. Yes it's a silly premise, but it is fun. Some people need to just chill sit back and enjoy these movies, and not take movies too seriously. Just have fun, like the guys who made this movie, cause these kinda movies take me back to being a kid. Kevin James is his usual funny self, Joe Rogan is hilarious in places, but only a few of the animals are really hilarious. It was an enjoyable movie. I don't understand people hating on these type of movies. I do understand the hate for 'vampires Suck', and 'Epic Movie' and 'Disaster Movie'. those are horrible movies that shouldn't never come to fruition. So, I would say go and watch this cause it's fun."", ""I just wanted to write a quick review, especially since all of the current reviews are so negative. I just saw this with my two young kids and they LOVED it! It is silly, funny and cute - just what I am looking for in a family movie. My kids were laughing out loud the whole time. If you are looking for a deep, thought-provoking, meaningful couple of hours this certainly isn't it, but it isn't pretending to be either. If you don't try to connect all the dots in the storyline and just take it for what it is, it is very entertaining. The animals are wonderful and have lots a great lines. And it doesn't hurt that this was filmed at my family's favorite zoo (Frankin Park Zoo near Boston).Just a good, solid family movie that the kids will enjoy."", 'The movie starts off a bit average. Once the Animals start talking, The fun begins and never lets you down. Small kids wont get most of the story but young adults and older will love the fun. My 68 year old mother slept through half of Transformers, and Cars 2 but never nodded once during this one. Real life situations and emotion are used cleverly to connect you to the characters. Chemistry between characters is excellent. I think the scene where the Gorilla gets to go to TGI Fridays is my favorite. The bears are my second favorites, going on at each other. Watching the King of the Jungle make and break his own rules are typical male who thinks he is in control when all along we know who is really boss, The Female of course. You will also enjoy the quality of the Animation of the Animal CGI. It looks Real, you will believe they are talking. It takes night at the museum quality to the next level.Entertaining and Funny. If you love animals, and other Adam Sandler Movies,You will love this one. Its entertainment and a fun at a level for all to enjoy. JC', 'Anyone that goes into a summer movie from Adam Sandler\'s production company, with talking animals and a comedy actor star simply has to take responsibility for their own actions, and their own reckoning process if they are not satisfied. They must stop moaning in public immediately, that a formula movie followed its formula, as it is unseemly and illogical to do so.My goodness! This is not ""Syriana,"" nor an Ingmar Bergman movie, nor something Sir John Gielgud would have been tempted to act in. This movie is a perfect example of its genre- a silly, warmhearted folly with a moral at the end. This much should be obvious to anyone who has ever entered a cinema before.I noticed a few rather grumpy audience members writing that they were ""shocked, shocked!"" that the talking animals were not real, and the jokes were puerile. One viewer even complained that the relationship between the zookeeper character and the gorilla was not realistic (Huh? It\'s a talking gorilla! It\'s a guy in a gorilla suit while another guy voices the words from a recording booth. Of course it\'s not ""realistic"" Hahahaha!).Kevin James has not been my favourite actor, I will admit. But I thought he did a fine job here. Much better than I had expected, after having seen his ""Paul Blart, Mall Cop"" (In my humble opinion, that was lame). James does seem to be a decent bloke in real life, and a lovely man. We all know a few comedians who have a veneer of a smile, but bad vibes underneath. Those few can give off a snarky or malicious vibe on the chat shows or even DVD commentaries- a bit of the weasel rumbling around in the real actor just underneath the character on screen --- but not James. I was not in the least repulsed, and actually liked him in this.The animals were a hoot. I only could guess two voices out of the 15 nor 20 in the zoo scenes. The others were a surprise, but completely logical when I read their identities on IMDb.You can safely ignore the self-righteous nay-sayers to this bit of fun. That is, if talking animals are to your taste in a lighthearted and goofy summer comedy.', 'My wife and I just returned from seeing ""Zookeeper,"" and were thoroughly delighted and amused. Excellent creation of the animals, with very nicely mouth movements to coordinate with the dialogue.Scripting was excellent - absolutely hilarious. The voicing for the animals (especially the monkey) was top-notch.Those who believe this is a children\'s\' movie is really missing the mark. At our viewing of the film (1:15 p.m. matinée), there were approximately 50 attendees - NO CHILDREN! Age ranges were from early 20s to mid 60s. The audience was roaring throughout the film, and continued to do so as they filed out of the auditorium - reflecting on their favorite parts. Some of the audience members stood in the lobby of the theater - strangers, mind you - chatting about the film and sharing some additional laughs.I have already read some so-called ""movie critics"" who are body-slamming this delightful film.

Only film in a very long time I have wanted to walk out in the middle. Several people from the screening that I was in (with only about 25 people total to start with) did leave, I envy them.Without going crazy on details, they basically took a few of the funny jokes from the first film and repeated them ad nauseam, until no humour could be derived in any way. Penelope cruz gave the worst performance of her career, so wooden and dull. They filled it with famous people, there must have been issues getting them to spend much time filming, it was clear none of them were being filmed at the same time. It would pan to each person individually and made a lot of the scenes very disjointed and hard to watch.I kept trying my best to get in to it, but it was just so so bad. Very disappointed.', 'Not a single laugh. Not at all. I wasn\'t treating this like a ""Don\'t laugh challenge"" or anything, there just genuinely isn\'t a funny moment in this travesty.Horrible cameos. Just... horrible. So many swing-and-misses with jokes - and the jokes are telegraphed from about 20 minutes earlier, including the ones in the first 20 minutes. Penelope Cruz is possibly the worst thing to happen ever. Actually no, I was much more devastated by Kristen Wig\'s performance as... whatever the sh*t she was meant to be doing that was funny.Everyone\'s going to watch it though - cos the first one was great. This is a money grab, thank god you don\'t have to pay to watch it.', ""First of all, as a spoiler alert, first ZOOLANDER is totally the best spoiler for this film. Same basic strictly commercial moves from guys who needs more, i don't know what, cause it's clear that those guys had everything, quite obviously.As a late thirty guy, an admirer of ZOOLANDER, this feature leaves me frustrated. Everything in this movie is completely same with the first movie. Even the humour. This is quite incredible, but jokes are exactly same(who am i?/ingabogovinanana -na -na -na -na/are you serious? am i the only one here? / i invented the blablabla / relax /and goes on like an avalanche of bad, cloned jokes.) just insert different celebrity cameos. Even the position of cameos are quite the same. Same name jokes, same behavioral jokes, same ending, same ridiculously same shi*t. I can't really understand what are the makers of this movie thinks. They don't have any obligation to carry (or create a franchise) obviously they have enough money. So just think harder and take your time to make something original.This is just torture to watch. I thought TROPIC THUNDER might be a good sequel to ZOOLANDER. with some minor changes, it could have been worked. By the way speaking of Tropic Thunder. That's a good example of entertaining and funny movie, i hope they'll never try to make a sequel. Zoolander is finished, I'm going to THE CENTER FOR MEN WHO DOESN'T LIKE ANYTHING MADE BY SENSELESS URGE TO HAVE MORE AND WANTS SOME REAL FUN."", ""Zoolander 2 is once again directed by Ben Stiller and we get to see Owen Wilson, Will Ferrell and Stiller himself return to their former roles, which is the one positive thing I can say about this movie. The cast is still good in their roles. Derek and Hansel are still the same characters and they play them with enthusiasm and Mugatu is well, OK. Sadly, everything else is pretty much garbage. The humor did not work at all and I just wanted it to be over. After 5 minutes of the movie I was just exhausted. This is a clear example that bigger does not mean better. I am a fan of the original Zoolander and one of the things I liked about that film is that it was just a small comedy with a relatively small budget and it evolved as a cult film. Zoolander 2 tries to be bigger than the first one and it just doesn't work. The first was pretty much about Mugatu trying to hypnotize a male model to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia. That was the plot. Stupid? Definitely, but it worked in its own right. This one's about Derek trying to locate his son, while male models are being assassinated, which actually did not pay off at all in the end. The movie is filled with unnecessary cameos and there can be too much of a good thing. It happened last year with the Entourage movie and now with this. Like I said, everything is bigger, the scope and even the effects, but what Stiller and his production crew don't get is that what made the original Zoolander so funny and good was that it seemed like they were taking a chance. It was kind of cheap and small but it worked.The film doesn't work at all but I'll say this: At least it didn't feel cynical. To me it seemed like they were actually trying to make a good film and a funny one but it just did not work. The humor is mostly like people getting hit in the face and stuff like that. The movie also tries way too hard to recall on things from the original that were funny. As a fan of the original and as a moviegoer in general, I would not recommend Zoolander 2. I laughed 5 times in the whole movie. I counted them. And as a comedy that's the main problem with the movie: It was not funny.1.5/10"", ""Fifteen years after the original comes this unfunny sequel with plot and jokes written on the back of a cigarette packet.The opening is promising enough with Justin Bieber as a series of pop singers have suddenly died with a certain look in their face. The look is associated with Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller.)In the meantime Derek has hit rock bottom when a building he designed collapsed killing his wife, he has lost his son to the authorities and hit rock bottom. However he is reunited with his old rival Hansel McDonald (Owen Wilson) also facially scarred in the building collapse and they are sent on a mission by the Interpol Fashion Police led by Valentina Valencia (Penélope Cruz) to find out who is killing these celebrities and why do they have one of Zoolander's signature look.There are plenty of celebrity cameos, some fun poked at the fashion industry and Derek wanting to get his son back. The plot is a pot pourri of different story strands meshed together but it is never coherent. There is nothing really funny going on, it is absurd but the jokes consistently miss the mark."", ""This movie made me Sad, Trying to squeeze a few more laughs out of the old jokes without even re-heating them. I loved the original, Quote it all the time, that will stop now as this movie left a sour taste in your mouth. There were so many chances for this movie to be funny or relevant but it misses them all. Its like the writers know nothing of the modern world or its written by out of touch 50 year old's. I waited years hoping for this movie and now I wish I had not. Don't waste your money Go see DEADPOOL so much better then Zoolander 2, I was really hoping this would be good but its not,, I need 10 lines to post this review so i am going to keep typing till IMDb lets me post this..."", 'This film gets a 3 due to the great work by the costume designers and set designers who obviously had a wonderful time being imaginative in this film. I also want to acknowledge Will Ferrell and Kristen Wiig giving it their all and giving us the only laughs in this film, but besides those elements, this film is empty and embarrassing. Most of the film goes like this ""It\'s funny because Justin Bieber!"", ""It\'s funny because Billy Zane!"", ""It\'s funny because \'UBER\', I know that thing!"", ""It\'s funny because Netflix!"", ""It\'s funny because that joke was in the first movie!""... So on and so forth, I am not exaggerating. Instead of the pretty well crafted jokes in the first film, we instead just get an endless series of references and god-awful cameos (Katy Perry shows us that even in a blockbuster film she can\'t sing at all), which do not constitute as jokes. When the film wasn\'t being funny, it was just being cringe-worthy, with predictable jokes, recycled jokes, and atrocious acting from the onslaught of celebs desperate for more attention, Bowie they Ain\'t. Shout Out to the kid who played Zoolander\'s Son, who was particularly cringe! But in the end, most of the fault lies will Stiller. The guy is wonderfully talented and has made some of the best mainstream US broad comedies of the last 20 years (Tropic Thunder, Cable Guy and Zoolander). Yet here he seems desperate to stay relevant, throwing endless crap at the screen, over-compensating for a lack of any good or original jokes in the screenplay. It comes off more as a high school 10 minute skit than a film by a 50 yr old comedy veteran. It seems all the biggest US comedy actors have just decided to make crap films in 2015/16, Will Ferrels appalling ""Daddy\'s Home"" and the sappy, melodramatic tripe of Seth Rogen\'s ""The Night Before"" and now this garbage (the less said about Sandler the better....) Pick it up guys!So 3/10 for the effort of Ferrell, Wiig and the people behind the scenes, but aside from that, this film was unbearable and embarrassing. (Also, A dishonourable mention to Kyle Mooney for being the worst part of this film by a mile)', ""Die-hard fans of the ridiculously good-looking Derek Zoolander and his so-hot-right-now supermodel buddy Hansel, brace yourself for disappointment. For this sequel is an almighty dud that tries its hardest to tarnish the hilariously silly awesomeness of the original. With more flat jokes and unintentional cringe-worthy moments than a typical Adam Sandler flick, this belated follow-up not only fails to recapture the idiotic glory of its predecessor but also struggles to muster more than the odd half-hearted giggle. Where the bone-headed jokes of the original were ripe for beer-assisted laughs, here they're stale, try-hardish and painfully unimaginative, relying too heavily on aping old gags instead of bringing Derek and Co. into 2016. Ben Stiller (as the eponymous male model), Owen Wilson (as the laconic stud Hansel) and Will Ferrell (as colourful megalomaniac Mugatu) commit 100% to their fan-favourite roles, yet their admirable efforts can't elevate the pedestrian script. There are cameos galore but majority of them are misplaced and forced – with a brief appearance by Sting offering the only glimmer of entertainment – whilst a bizarre CGI-face-replaced character is unfathomably pathetic and epitomises all that is wrong with this sequel. It doesn't quite reach the comedic lows of say Ted 2 or The Campaign, however Zoolander 2 is an embarrassingly weak movie that dissatisfies deeply."", ""I actually went out of my way to sign up to IMDb to comment on this movie to let people know to save their money and disappointment for something else. Maybe saying it's hot garbage is too harsh, it could be called terrible recycling for using all of the same jokes from the original. I gave this movie 3 out of 10, for the 3 actual times that I laughed during the screening. Do yourself a favor and look at the people departing the screening before you buy a ticket and you won't see any smiles or laughter its a good in dictator on how great a comedy is. It's too bad we don't have a system for paying for movies after the fact instead of beforehand so that movies like this wouldn't get made. Please do not go to this movie and reward lazy Hollywood so that we can prevent movies like this being made in the future."", ""I really liked the original Zoolander, with its unique brand of cleverly dumb comedy, but I never thought we needed a sequel. Nonetheless, when Zoolander 2 was announced, I was looking forward to it, and with a couple of pretty entertaining trailers, I thought that this wasn't going to be one of those awful comedy sequels.Oh, how wrong I was.I'm sorry to say that Zoolander 2 is easily one of the worst comedy sequels I've ever seen. Apart from a couple of chuckles, it failed to make me laugh on a consistent basis, further angering me as it got more and more boring and irritating as the film unfolded. Its story makes absolutely no sense, and the narrative gets completely tangled up on numerous occasions, destroying any enjoyment you could have found in the film away from the terrible comedy, making this a thoroughly dull and difficult movie to watch from start to finish.The main thing we have to talk about here is how bad the comedy is. All comedy sequels are tough to do, but normally, by keeping everything pretty similar, you can get an entertaining movie. The problem with Zoolander 2 is that it completely fails to deliver the brilliant sense of humour that first film had.The original Zoolander wasn't a dumb film, in fact it was a really clever comedy that centred around a dumb character. The jokes were well-written, and the majority of the humour stemmed from those main characters. In the sequel, however, the comedy is just dumb. Relying WAY too heavily on celebrity cameos for cheap laughs, and just completely underwhelming gags on a constant basis, there's very little to laugh at.I will admit I chuckled a couple of times. Benedict Cumberbatch's slightly offensive transgender character that you've seen in the trailers was pretty good, and a couple of the jokes they did satirising modern social media and hipsters etc. weren't too bad either.Apart from that, this is a hugely unfunny film, and I'd say about 95% of all of the jokes completely miss the mark. Sometimes, when there was a joke, it would take me a few seconds to realise that it was actually meant to be funny. And when I say sometimes, I mean pretty much all the time, which shows you just how unfunny this is.Now, that's the main objective of a comedy: to make you laugh. But, seeing as that failed completely in Zoolander 2, maybe the story could have salvaged something.No, it didn't. The plot here is absolutely atrocious. Whilst the first film had a clear focus, Derek being brainwashed to kill the Malaysian Prime Minister, everything in the sequel is all over the place. At some points they're looking for the assassins, sometimes they're just trying to do fashion, sometimes they want to find Derek's son, and all sorts of other rubbish that made this a hugely messy film that failed to interest or entertain me at any point.Now, I've been really harsh to Zoolander 2 here, and although I think it definitely deserves heavy criticism, there is one thing that I do have to praise, and that's Ben Stiller's directing. Much like the first film, Zoolander 2 looks very stylish, just like the world of high fashion should be. Every scene is fantastically put together, the action sequences are brilliantly choreographed, and it is generally a very nice film to look at.That's it for positives, though. Overall, Zoolander 2 was a painfully disappointing film. It completely fails to live up to its predecessor, but most importantly, it almost never makes you laugh, and with such a huge amount of jokes coming your way, it becomes quickly annoying and horrendously dull to watch."", 'The original ""Zoolander"" accumulated a moderate US box office gross of $45,172,250. It developed a life of its own on video and DVD, becoming a cult hit. The sequel has finally arrived 15 years later. Was it worth the wait? Did it have to be made? The answer to both questions is a resounding \'no\'. There\'s just not enough story material to stretch the length to over 100 minutes. It\'s a flimsy story with many unfunny scenes but there\'s still enough amusing moments to justify your time and money.Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) has gone into seclusion after the death of his wife (Christine Taylor) from a building that he constructed for children with poor reading skills. His son, Derek Jr (Cyrus Arnold) has been sent to an orphanage in Rome because Derek has been deemed as an unfit father. Meanwhile, Derek\'s main rival in the modeling world, Hansel (Owen Wilson), has also retired due to a facial injury suffered during the same building collapse that killed Derek\'s wife. He has been living in a hippie commune which also includes Kiefer Sutherland playing himself. They are brought together when famous celebrities like Justin Bieber have been killed, but before taking their last breath, they post a Derek Zoolander \'Blue Steel\' look on social media. Interpol agent Valentina (Penélope Cruz) recognizes that look and calls upon Derek and Hansel to investigate just who is killing all those celebrities. At the same time, Derek tries to reconnect with his son when his investigations take him to the same city where is now residing.If you haven\'t seen the original ""Zoolander"", you could still see the sequel as the opening scenes are a news montage of what has happened to Derek since being the king of the modeling world. You get a fair idea of who Derek Zoolander is and what his accomplishments were from this montage. If you are familiar with the personality of Derek then you\'ll know that he is a child trapped in a man\'s body. And that\'s still the case 15 years later. He mangles the English language and finds himself in situations that test his limited intelligence. Stiller plays him to perfection and he maintains an excellent rapport with Wilson who delights in his role as Stiller\'s rival. Other cast members don\'t fare as well. Ferrell reprises his role as Mugatu from the first film and he is in overacting mode along with Wiig who is Mugatu\'s co- conspirator. Cruz adds sex appeal and sauciness in her sidekick role to Derek. If you like to play the game of spot the celebrities, you will be in for a fun time. Just about every major fashion designer has a cameo along with celebrity appearances from the movie and music world including Benedict Cumberbatch (as an androgynous supermodel!), Susan Sarandon, Milla Jovovich, Macauley Culkin, Billy Zane, Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Sting, Kate Moss...the list goes on! It probably has the most cameos ever in a movie. The main problem with this film lies in the story. There\'s not much to work with and it doesn\'t help when a lot of the scenes linger to try to eke out any laughs from the jokes. When the actors are trying this hard to make viewers laugh without succeeding then you know that the original cult status should have remained untouched as the sequel might damage its credibility. What saves this film is the likability factor of both Derek and Hansel, plus the way they react together.Many scenes of Rome were shot in an Italian studio and it\'s remarkable how real Rome looks. Some of the action stunts also add to the visual appeal of the movie. I wasn\'t a huge fan of the original ""Zoolander"" but it was still better than this offering. Sometimes it\'s best to retire much-loved movie characters to preserve their \'dignity\' and in this sequel, we have been provided with a classic example of this theory. http://mlaimlai2.wix.com/magical-movie-review', ""If you're a fan of the first film it's at least worth a watch. While the film feels disjointed and situations are forced, it still has a few really funny moments.Like many sequels it suffers from trying to have too many callbacks to the first film. A lot of jokes are shoehorned in for a quick laugh.One of the problems is that in a weird way the film is almost too silly. The original felt way more grounded despite being totally absurd at the same time. The two elements contrasted very well and enhanced the humor.I'm a bit disappointed that this is the best they could come up with after all this time but I can't say I wasn't entertained and that I didn't laugh."", 'Some 15 years since the original, and fabulous, Zoolander I\'ve been looking forward to this sequel for some time. Though not officially released until the 12th Feb it was being shown this weekend so I took a chance to get in early and see if it lived up to my expectations\x85 Well I think it did, it\'s great to see Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) and Hansel (Owen Wilson) back on screen and they hardly look a day older than 15 years ago. Just as crazy, stupid and insane as the original film it\'s hard to pick many holes in the action or storyline, other than overplaying the ""models are stupid"" card (which, nevertheless, is still funny) and the crazy number of cameos in the film (lost count, and didn\'t actually recognise them all) with the best cameo being Benedict Cumberbatch, brilliant.There were plenty of proper laugh out loud moments, with possibly my favourite scene being the first one with Mugatu (Will Ferrell) so keep an eye out for that one. One of the scenes has been used in the trailer (which I\'ve seen several times) and I still laughed again, it\'s that funny.With that said, on the whole the film isn\'t up there with the best. It\'s a superb sequel to what has become a bit of a cult film and maybe with time this will get there too. If you loved the first, you\'ll love this but if you\'ve not seen the first then I\'d suggest you check it out before spending your money cause it may not be your bag.', ""Here is the thing - too many times I have made a mistake to watch a film only based on it's IMDb rating or reviews.This crucial piece of information that is missing here is:who is rating/reviewing the title? which other films did the one love/hate?That is why I want to give some information about me before giving my two cents on Zoolander2:35 year old male as a kid I loved Mel Brooks films, Hot Shots Franchise, Jim Carrey Works... I love brother Farrelly comedies I enjoy most of Ben Stiller works (Cable Guy, Tropic Thunder...)Now, with this information in mind, we can proceed:In spite of bad ratings I chose to watch this one, and I didn't regret it. It is a well crafted over the top comedy with some clever and satirical gags.Because of the fact that it's over the top - from start to finish, I don't have any problems with the story. I guess it just depends on the mindset and maybe the mood. Both me and my wife had many laughs during the whole film. Was it predictable? Yes. But I wasn't expecting it to be any different :)I hope this helps. Peace out."", ""The returning cast, a slew of cameos, and a good bunch of laughs. A stale plot for sure, and overly dramatic music, but with that aside, Zoolander 2 does offer a substantial amount of laughs to be had.I don't quite understand the reason for all the bad reviews. I watched Zoolander 2 immediately after watching the first, and I honestly think number 2 is funnier. There are plenty of references to the original Zoolander, and the movie becomes more funny if you think of it as a satire on 60-70s spy movies, with the exaggerated music and all.If you enjoyed the Austin Powers series, then you will likely enjoy Zoolander 2 very much.Put your judgment aside from the other negative reviews, and give Zoolander 2 a go. You might just find it's funnier than the original."", 'Back in 2001, when the first Zoolander came out, people wrote it off as tired and juvenile. How the tables have turned in 2016, so that same exact humor is exactly what we don\'t get enough of. It\'s not Hangover cool, or 21 Jump Street silly. An acquired taste, sure, but in a way it\'s a little more brilliant than those other comedies. It\'s completely stupid, but in the most well thought out way possible. Zoolander 2 doesn\'t skip a beat in giving us that same exact charm that made the first one so great. In certain ways it\'s funnier than the original. The world around Derek Zoolander has changed, but he definitely hasn\'t. Ben Stiller, who writes, directs, and stars in the film, gives us plenty of new lines to quote and a gang of new characters who are just as weird and off-kilter as the originals. It\'s absolutely ridiculous, but at the same time, it doesn\'t exploit every chance it gets to make an innocuous joke. If you take this film too seriously, it will go over your head.From the opening scene, you realize you\'re in for the same unwieldy satire that made the first one so great. Justin Bieber--one of a few dozen cameos--takes an Instagram selfie after being shot to death.Someone is killing pop stars, and Interpol agent, Valentina Valencia (Penelope Cruz), is trying to figure out why. She hires Derek Zoolander (Stiller) and his former rival-turned-friend Hansel (Owen Wilson) to help crack the case. Derek has been living as a ""hermit crab"" recluse since his wife died and his son was taken into protective custody. And Hansel, after suffering a career- ending facial scar, is living somewhere in the desert in an 11-person marriage.About 45 minutes in or so, as the plot really starts to develop, the humor doesn\'t quite keep up, since the characters are at their best when they\'re just bantering back and forth. But nonetheless there are plenty of things to keep us entertained.And then Will Ferrell, as Zoolander\'s arch-nemesis Mugatu, shows up in the movie, just as crazy as he was in the original. Then things turn zany and a little darker than they already are. Amidst the action-packed 2nd act, there\'s a great dialogue sequence between Derek and Mugatu where the villain tries to trick Derek into switching places with him in prison. Seeing the two of them on screen together is something to behold.The plot gets a little convoluted here and there, but many things in this movie don\'t make sense. That\'s the genius of it. Surrealistic comedy has somewhat gone by the wayside these days, but Stiller is still helping to keep it alive. He recruits another young talent in Kyle Mooney, who is trying to do the same thing. Mooney, doing a take on one of his own popular characters, plays a young model who talks in his own incomprehensible lingo and makes retro shirts from phrases that were said just 15 minutes ago. Perhaps he was chosen for this role because Stiller sees a little bit of himself in Mooney--the ability to not care if anyone else thinks he\'s funny, as long as he can make himself laugh. That\'s something to admire.Twizard Rating: 81', ""Thank you Derek Zoolander for gracing our lives once again. In no way can I say that Zoolander 2 is the most intellectual piece of comedy ever written, but neither was the first one. Filled with cheap jokes and silly accents I was shocked to find myself in tears of utter and complete manic hilarity. I'm tempted to even say that although it is unlikely to ever become more iconic than the original, it could possibly be even better. For a minute there the movie even convinced me to like Justin Bieber. The genius of this film is in its blatant stupidity so purposefully weaved into the smallest expressions (Kiefer Sutherland especially) and built around characters so horrid though impossible not to love. For those who are going in highbrow to watch and critique Zoolander 2 you are sure to be sourly disappointed. Highly recommended for people with low to medium expectations and a thirst to see Benedict Cumberbatch flaunting his more humorous acting abilities."", ""I just want to start out by saying that I really enjoyed the movie. That's not to say that it didn't have it's problems, but it excelled in what mattered most: It was an excellent representation of what made the original so great. I think if this movie had come out 10-15 years ago, after the first movie, it would be receiving a slew of positive reviews. The humor is the same, the acting is the same, and the writing is the same. By that I mean the whole movie's pretty corny, with dumb one liners and intentionally bad acting, but when you get right down to it the original was too. What's currently popular changes extremely quickly, especially in the comedy world. With that in mind, the style of the movie feels dated. But anyone complaining about how it doesn't stand up to the original or that it's a bust is viewing the first Zoolander through heavy nostalgia glasses. Zoolander was always corny, the acting was always dumb, the writing corny, that's what made it great. The negative reviews ignore what made Zoolander great in the first place. Don't get me wrong, I love the new style of comedies; those mixed with action like Kingsman, those more mainstream like 21 Jump Street, and the dry existential comedies like Grand Budapest Hotel, but if you can allow yourself to forgive a bit of corniness and just watch this movie with the same sensibilities you viewed the original, you'll be in for a lot of laughs. Like Derek and Hansel the style's a bit washed up, but at it's core the movie is still the best of it's kind. If you can leave behind your cynicism and doubt for a few hours, you'll find yourself laughing throughout the whole movie (with some parts hitting or missing a little more than others). The bottom line is that if you still like the original for its humor rather than for nostalgic reasons, you'll like this movie too."", ""Zoolander 2 - That name would suggest that it would be very similar to the first one, so I don't really understand why these reviews are so bad.I read the reviews before I saw it, so maybe it helped that I thought it would be horrible, even though usually the opposite is true. Also, I REALLY liked the first one. I enjoy ridiculous/awkward comedies and most of the actors in this movie. I have no idea how someone who says they loved the first one isn't a fan of this one.This movie was awesome. Personally, I think it was overdue and should have been made years ago when the concept and comedy of Zoolander was still in people's heads. The jokes and one-liners were right on par with those in the first one, acting from the MAIN ACTORS was spot-on, and I laughed my balls off. We went on a Friday night in an empty theater, so I don't know how a big theater crowd would react, but I loved it. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson fell right back into character perfectly and were very funny. Kyle Mooney was hilarious, I wish he had a larger part. Will Ferrell was decent, his performance started out strong, but got out of hand towards the end. Fred Armisen could have been funny, but fell a little flat. Kristen Wiig was deece.The movie has a dumb story, but I think that's the point. The whole thing is how dumb these guys are, how being dumb gets them in trouble, and they get caught up in these dumb story lines and in the end, they are still dumb. That's it, and thats funny to me.I do have some complaints, but they definitely aren't enough to keep me from watching again. The story got too ambitious at the end. Its like they didn't know how to end it, when something much simpler could have been satisfying enough. Also, as others have mentioned, the designer cameos were a disaster. They should have cut all dialogue from them. In my personal opinion, I think the movie would have been awesome with a bunch of comedians playing fake designers (Almost like the Anchorman fight scene). In conclusion, if you liked the original, see this movie, it's great. If you didn't like Zoolander, this movie isn't for you."", 'I was a huge fan of the original Zoolander movie. I was afraid that this sequel might not be funny. Right from the beginning this movie was awesome. The cameos were terrific. There was enough of the old cast, and some great new additions. The overall story made sense and drove the humor. The humor was very well thought out. There were some crude jokes, but there were also a bunch there that you might miss. There were some surprises also. Once again they paid great attention to the music used. I feel like this movie is as good as the original if not better. I really hope they make a third, keep up the good work! Great movie.']",25,['Comedy']

All of the characters are perfunctory parts rather than humans portraying genuine conflicts.Also, for a film that\'s called ""Zoom,"" the film drags: it lacks a sufficient amount of action. We\'re supposed to see the kids train, but all we\'re mostly shown are unfunny attempts at slapstick humor that the filmmakers assume would elicit laughters from the little tots among the audience (uhm, Courteney Cox tripping down and Chevy Chase getting slime on his face, anyone?). What constitutes for training involve at the most paint balls and a drive-thru chaos at a Wendy\'s restaurant. Yes, there\'s the climactic fight sequence at the end but it\'s too quick, unexciting, and not enough by a mile for a film that has terribly dragged along.Ultimately, what transpires is a terribly unfunny movie that wears out its welcome faster than its main character runs.', 'An odd group of super hero misfits must be shaped up by a dimwitted leader Zoom (Money whore Tim Allen). Some of the child actors are okay but their powers and the whole back story is foggy. Despite they need to be trained at the Academy there was, for me, no good reason to care. Allen after doing ""Shaggy Dog"" (another runner up for worst of 06) shows that despite the god awful taste in film selections he is just doing it for the MONEY. So the next Allen flick that comes out don\'t expect some kind of descent film just expect Tim laughing it up on screen pulling ridiculous stunts like ""Zoom"".

While Cox plays the stand out role of a mother/wife, who has slowly and methodically grown distant and quite mad over the years of their marriage, I believe that Allen's performance is just as impressive and equally mad. In dealing with a wife who is as immature as his own children, Allen is reduced to dealing with her in extreme and embarrassing ways.The tension begins when Captain Zoom, played by Allen brings his co-workers back to his house in the morning after a long night shift, which probably was not the smartest idea because he had broken a long standing date with his wife the previous night. I suppose he brought them back for his own protection, thinking that maybe the presence of other might help to suppress an incident with his wife. Her bazaar awkward interactions build until Captain Zoom has to yell at Marsha (Cox). From there it only gets worse. Marsha's fickle and fragile mental state makes for a strange situation for her children. After practically kicking them out of the house in the morning, a few minutes later, she is begging for their presence once again. She waits in frantic anticipation for the bus to arrive and collects her children at the foot of the bus like a mother has not seen her kids for years. The way in which she acts towards the father of her children's play date is that of a twelve year old. The father does not seem comfortable at with leaving his children with a woman who he thought to be drunk, but later finds out just to be mad. After he tells her so, her demeanor immediately changes once again and she has a look of shame, like a child who has just been scorned by a disappointed parent. Allen arrives in a fit of rage that seems a bit over the top. He strikes her and it is in this scene that one realizes the exhausting effects that his wife's strange behavior has on him. It drives him to lash out and act in equally irrational ways. His patience is constantly being tested.This is a common theme throughout the movie. It seems that every family member seems to have the right idea of how to fix this family and is not afraid to voice their opinion. Captain Zoom's mother is one such character. One of the final scenes is when the family is gathered around the dinner table after Marsha's return from the hospital. Captain Zoom's mother and other family members refuse to accept Marsha's request to be alone with her immediate family thinking that the best thing for her is to have people around. This ends badly and Marsha is almost forced into a type of relapse. Captain Zoom is constantly trying to keep a dictatorial control over his family no matter what the cost - understandably so, as he has been pushed to this point psychologically and physically as he strikes Marsha into sanity once again.The movie is a strange demonstration of family life. I think it's extremes are meant to display that all families have their problems and deal with them under their own circumstances. Is it right for others to intervene? Who makes that decision? The voyeuristic quality in which the film was shot also incites a feeling of guilt in the audience for witnessing such atrocities and also instills a feeling that they are a present member of the family and a first hand witness to the troubles that they are experiencing.

The only way a movie should get 10 stars is if it would be difficult to improve upon and the only way a movie should get 1 star is if it was absolutely ineptly made on every level, and I assure you this movie doesn't come close to that. Even solely rating on personal taste and ignoring the technical filmmaking and how successfully the movie achieves the filmmakers' apparent intent, this movie could hardly be in the worst 10% of movies for anyone's taste.This movie fails in many respects, but it has some redeeming moments and taken as a movie for small kids, it's not bad. The humor and acting both fall flat or miss the mark about as often as they're on target, but that is a sign of mediocrity, not atrocity.Unfortunately at this point most of the IMDb users seem to think that if they enjoyed a movie they should give it a 10 and if it wasn't all they hoped for they should give it a 1.

Too many movie-goers these days seem to only see movies as either being the best thing ever or the worst thing ever. The only way a movie should get 10 stars is if it would be difficult to improve upon and the only way a movie should get 1 star is if it was absolutely ineptly made on every level, and I assure you this movie doesn't come close to that. Even solely rating on personal taste and ignoring the technical filmmaking and how successfully the movie achieves the filmmakers' apparent intent, this movie could hardly be in the worst 10% of movies for anyone's taste.This movie fails in many respects, but it has some redeeming moments and taken as a movie for small kids, it's not bad.

If the one liner isn't enough to make you laugh, add the highly adorable factor from Ryan Newman as Cindy Collins is tops. The rest of the cast works very well together and even though there is a lot of predictability in the movie, it is still very funny and worth the watch. This is not a literary classic brought to life, so don't expect it to be.

But that's Tim Allen. The kids, on the other hand, they were unbearable.The Invisible Boy was by all means annoying and inconsiderate, and he frequently make me bonkers and as I tried to find my way around the story's incredibly boring plot, he made it worst. The young strong girl - ugh, I hated her character. She was bratty, spoiled and inconceivable. It looked like she made friends through fear by using her strength rather than be less of a burden.

While Cox plays the stand out role of a mother/wife, who has slowly and methodically grown distant and quite mad over the years of their marriage, I believe that Allen's performance is just as impressive and equally mad. In dealing with a wife who is as immature as his own children, Allen is reduced to dealing with her in extreme and embarrassing ways.The tension begins when Captain Zoom, played by Allen brings his co-workers back to his house in the morning after a long night shift, which probably was not the smartest idea because he had broken a long standing date with his wife the previous night. I suppose he brought them back for his own protection, thinking that maybe the presence of other might help to suppress an incident with his wife. Her bazaar awkward interactions build until Captain Zoom has to yell at Marsha (Cox). From there it only gets worse. Marsha's fickle and fragile mental state makes for a strange situation for her children. After practically kicking them out of the house in the morning, a few minutes later, she is begging for their presence once again. She waits in frantic anticipation for the bus to arrive and collects her children at the foot of the bus like a mother has not seen her kids for years. The way in which she acts towards the father of her children's play date is that of a twelve year old. The father does not seem comfortable at with leaving his children with a woman who he thought to be drunk, but later finds out just to be mad. After he tells her so, her demeanor immediately changes once again and she has a look of shame, like a child who has just been scorned by a disappointed parent. Allen arrives in a fit of rage that seems a bit over the top. He strikes her and it is in this scene that one realizes the exhausting effects that his wife's strange behavior has on him. It drives him to lash out and act in equally irrational ways. His patience is constantly being tested.This is a common theme throughout the movie. It seems that every family member seems to have the right idea of how to fix this family and is not afraid to voice their opinion. Captain Zoom's mother is one such character. One of the final scenes is when the family is gathered around the dinner table after Marsha's return from the hospital. Captain Zoom's mother and other family members refuse to accept Marsha's request to be alone with her immediate family thinking that the best thing for her is to have people around. This ends badly and Marsha is almost forced into a type of relapse. Captain Zoom is constantly trying to keep a dictatorial control over his family no matter what the cost - understandably so, as he has been pushed to this point psychologically and physically as he strikes Marsha into sanity once again.The movie is a strange demonstration of family life. I think it's extremes are meant to display that all families have their problems and deal with them under their own circumstances. Is it right for others to intervene? Who makes that decision? The voyeuristic quality in which the film was shot also incites a feeling of guilt in the audience for witnessing such atrocities and also instills a feeling that they are a present member of the family and a first hand witness to the troubles that they are experiencing.
